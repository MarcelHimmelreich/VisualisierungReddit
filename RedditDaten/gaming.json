Paintings and pictures need to use all sorts of focusing tricks, shading tricks to translate the 3D inspiration the artist had into a 2D piece that reflects that. Meanwhile, sculpture can far more accurately depict the vision the artist had. \n\nWe have always treated movies and games as moving pictures, and 3D movies and games as moving pictures made 3D. We very, very rarely treat 3D as something else; we rarely treat 3D as *moving sculpture*. When we do the first, we lose so much because you no longer see the beauty of the translation into 2D, nor do you get to see that portrayal of the original vision. \n\nBut when we do the second... Suddenly we have movies like Hugo and Life of Pi, that are cluttered and difficult to focus on in 2D but in 3D, come to life like tiny models that really move. \n\nAnd that's what we could have done with video games. Strategy games are the ideal use for 3D. Civilization with mountains that truly seem impassible, with tiny planes flying high above cities. RTS games where your eye would naturally focus on each part of the battle, which would be so much easier with less mental clutter. Even online 3D chess or D&D, the 3D aspect making it easier to visualize. \n\nIf there had been respect for the medium, 3D could have been great.
