As long as the big developers have their leashes held by stockholders and multi-millionaire CEO's, they will continue to try to find new and innovative ways to bleed their consumers and employees dry. The big guys could make 100,000% profits on a game and a trillion dollars, and they will still keep looking for the next new exciting monetization or outsourcing strategies.
