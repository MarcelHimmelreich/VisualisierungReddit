If you push the lock button on your iPhone 5 times it pulls up an emergency calling feature as well as the phone owners emergency contact/medical information if they have filled it out. If you\u2019re ever in a situation and you don\u2019t want someone to see you making a call this makes it much easier to quickly call 911. Once it pulls up you just swipe the emergency sos part and it calls right away. Also if you ever find someone who is unconscious/unable to speak but they have an iPhone this is a way to get their emergency contacts as well as any important medical information if they have filled out their information on the health app that comes with the phone. No phone log in needed. Highly recommend everyone to fill theirs out. \n\nWARNING: had to edit this to add (now that it\u2019s happened a few times) that before attempting this you should check your settings to make sure you have auto call turned off otherwise your phone will not prompt you and instead will immediately call 911. \n\nEdit: I have an iPhone 7 so for anyone with an iPhone 8 and above you have to push both the lock button and one of the volume buttons at the same time to use this feature. Thank you to u/saucystassi for bringing this up!\n\nEdit 2: From what I can find on the Apple website the alarm some people hear is from iPhone 8 and higher versions. On the website it shows that if you go to your settings and then to emergency sos you can turn the countdown sound off and auto call off to stop the alarm from going off.\n\nAlso, it says that after the emergency call is placed it will send a text to your emergency contacts that a call to emergency services has been placed with your current location unless you hit cancel. \n\nAnd another thing, you can turn auto call on in your settings where your phone will automatically call 911 instead of showing a slider with options.

You know a sine wave, or even an ocean wave? How it goes up and down? Imagine that. Sounds are mechanical vibrations that affect air particles or whatever medium it travels through, and when it reaches your ear, the little hair-like magic pieces in your inner ear turn that into something we can understand.\n\nThis also explains why in space, no one can hear you scream. Space is entirely silent because there are no particles to transfer the sound waves between each other, for as we know, space is an almost perfect vacuum.\n\nHowever, if sounds are just waves, then what is volume and pitch?\n\nAmplitude and frequency, respectively. \n\nWhat amplitude is is the height of the wave, how big it is. When a sound wave is really tall, it is loud. Makes sense, if you think about it. Think about all the things that can create loud sounds. Say, a car crash. If the car crash's contact creates the sound waves, and it hits with a lot of force, it's going to create big waves (think a big rock hitting water vs a small rock-- the splash and ripples are gonna be taller with the big rock). \n\nOk, so we have the volume of the sound being directly proportional to the height of the wave (amplitude).\n\nWhat about frequency, or pitch?\n\nFrequency is how fast the wave *cycles.* What does this mean? Well, waves cycle. Imagine a sine wave. Feel free to look it up if you can't remember what it looks like. Effectively, the more horizontally squished the wave is, the higher the pitch of the sound. In other words, the more cycles/second (frequency) of a sound wave, the higher pitch it is. This doesn't sound very intuitive, I know, but when you hear something go up in pitch, it's actually a wave raising in frequency. You know how adults can't hear certain pitches, and dogs can hear a whole range above us? That's the frequency, and the body's ability or inability to process it. High-frequency dog whistles are silent to us because our ears can't pick it up. If you're interested in a fun result of frequency=pitch, look up the doppler effect.\n\nOk, so now we understand how sound works. The louder it is, the taller the wave, and pitch scales proportionally with frequency. \n\nRecords just take the mechanical wave, and carve it. They are known as an *analog* medium, as in analogous. It takes the information that exists, and translates it literally into another form of media. So, all these grooves are the literal soundwave translated onto a disc. The louder the sound, the deeper the groove, the lower the pitch, the slower that it goes up and down. The reason it's on a disc is because the circle allows for a much longer sound wave to be recorded in less space.\n\nAs for how it actually works? Well, I'm sure you've figured it out by now.\n\nThe needle touches the carved wave, and moves up and down at a rate that is determined by the grooves. This emulates the vibrations of the mechanical sound wave that it copies, and it produces a faint sound. This faint sound is amplified by the phonograph's horn, or whatever a specific modern version has, and then beautiful music comes out!\n\nTL;DR: The grooves in a record emulate the mechanical sound waves that it recorded, and the pin moving along the grooves makes that physical version of the wave into sound again, and then the horn makes it loud.\n\nEDIT: If you're interested in how sound becomes digital, and why some recordings are higher quality than others, feel free to ask!

How in the world do you turn that into electricity? Because that is the goal. Everything works off electricity in computers. We like to romanticize \"the digital,\" imagining some ethereal space, but in reality the most effective way to record something is to turn it from mechanical to electric, from which software can function.\n\nIn electrical engineering, we have voltage, which is the difference in potential energy from one end to another. What the heck does that mean? Hold something above the ground. The object now has potential energy relative to the ground. It is equal to the total kinetic energy that would accumulate if it would be dropped. It's a way of measuring the difference in energy states in two locations. The voltage is the electrical potential energy, from one component to the next. It also can function as a handy value that the computer's interpreters can understand.\n\nSo you have a wave. Imagine that as a function, a curve on a graph. How do you approximate the wave effectively? You collect a number of points on the curve, right?\n\nIf you had f(x) = x, you could approximate it by sending information each second, with each second representing an increase in the x-value by 1. So you could sent t=0, 0; t=1, 1; t=3, 3; and so on. With that info, the computer can approximate the graph pretty well!\n\nThis applies to the sound because that is called *sampling.* The number of times each second that the computer is told the y-value of the graph is its sampling. How is this transmitted? If you recall correctly, the way computers can get physical inputs is through electricity, so the microphone \"sends out\" (I say that because it's not quite the right terminology, but it communicates the idea) a voltage reading that would represent the y-value of the sound wave.\n\nIn summary, the microphone takes the vibrations and 'turns it into' voltage, which the computer can then read through electrical components and simulate the graph of the sound wave. The process works in reverse with speakers.\n\nBut then why do some things sound better than others, and why are vinyls considered 'sonically perfect' if a computer just records the sound?\n\nThink of the sampling. Now, I could basically take two samples at any second-interval for a linear graph, as the change is constant, but if I have a super funky graph with high highs and sharp drops and steep climbs and little erratic jolts (AKA a musical soundwave), if I sample at a lower rate, it will miss *a lot* of the detail of the music, creating a bad sound with less detail and a thinner sound. The music doesn't often stutter, as the computer digitally bridges the gap between the samples, but that creates a sound that isn't really what we wanted.\n\nThat's why we care about higher quality recording equipment, as they can sample more in a given time interval and more realistically portray the music. This is also why vinyls are ideal, as there is no *loss* (the term for the information lost between samples), as the sound wave is continuously analogously recorded.\n\nTL;DR: Computers need discrete digital information rather than the sound wave, which is a continuous multifaceted piece of information. [The microphone converts the 'height' of the wave into discrete voltage-based information packets on given times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing\\)#/media/File:Signal_Sampling.png), which can be interpreted by the computer. This is called sampling. We care about this because if it samples less in a given interval, more information about the wave is lost and the computer bridges the gap in a non-realistic way, creating lower quality music when the digital wave is played.\n\nSide note: It's pretty freaky to imagine that a voice, a violin, guitar, a drum, and a tuba can all be expressed within a single wave, all as the same information, since we imagine them all to have unique signatures. But in the end, they're all mechanical sound waves, and if this weren't true, then we couldn't have mono sound (a song coming from one source), and we couldn't have a single channel on a vinyl. We try to emulate the realistic sound of multiple different waves using stereo sound (a song being split up into components recorded seperately and played from seperate speakers -- surround sound), but all of these things are fundamentally the same.", "score": 68, "likes": 0, "upvote": 68, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "parksandcrepes", "id": "e5cf0sp", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9ckumr/what_is_something_you_genuinely_do_not_understand/e5cf0sp/", "content": " Thank you for taking the time to explain this in such detail. \n\nFrom a sound engineer who's tried to explain it in layman's before and failed, I salute you.", "score": 17, "likes": 0, "upvote": 17, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "GTFonMF", "id": "e5bkg8r", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9ckumr/what_is_something_you_genuinely_do_not_understand/e5bkg8r/", "content": "How people are able to turn every public washroom into an absolute crime scene.

All of my diligent observations began when I was in the first grade and wanted desperately to have friends.  I've been watching my whole life, and now I can't tell if at age 30 I watch so carefully because I want friends, or I want to be well liked (there is a difference).  So, if yours is a serious question, I have a very broad and arm-chair answer I can offer.\n\nSaying you like something is actually a considerable risk in the game of social dynamics.  Saying you DON'T like something presents virtually no risk when you're interacting with people, and creates a surface level bond if someone agrees with you.  This bond is dangerous and can lead to a lot of negativity; a situation where we blindly hate things with one or a group of people just to maintain the fragile, if not non-existent, connection with one another.  I call them \"hate loops\".  There is also the simple and naive assumption that our way of doing things is the best way, and other cultures or communities just haven't figured it out yet.  This is because our judgments our based on our experiences, and for some reason, most people subconsciously think that their place in the universe is on a set path that could not have gone any other way.  This is especially true of people who believe they are content or happy.  They presume that because they've arrived at this place of contentment, the only path to this place was the one that they took.\n\nNow, saying what you like rather than what you don't like is a risk because you've now have staked a claim in something, and are saying to the group that this new thing they've never heard of is of some value to you, and you're happy it exists.  On some level, most people when they're very comfortable do not like thinking about new things, or even that their perceptions were somehow incomplete.  Also, by you staking a claim in something, and telling them about it, you've now presumed to know them in such a way as to know whether or not they like something before they've ever interacted at all with it.

You know that 10-7=3. However, it can't be 3 because you have that little bit of .42. So, it's for sure 2 and something. 42 is almost 50. So, it's 2.50 something. To get to 50 required 8, so your change should be $2.58.\n\nAnother example is $9.63, and you pay with a $20. You know that since your total doesn't exceed 10, that you'll get at least 10 back. For the total to pay to reach 10, you need another dollar, except there's a bit extra of .63. Again, this is almost .5, except we're going the other way now. This means that you're getting back at most .50. It takes 13 cents to go from 50 to 63. So, subtract from 50 to get 37. Therefore, your total change will be $10.37.\n\nIt takes practice. Pick a total charge, and then pick an amount you could reasonably pay with, and calculate it out like I did above. Just step through it smoothly, and logically. Then, check your answer with a calculator by subtracting amount owed from amount paid. If they match what you wrote, you did it.\n\nAs for simple division and multiplication, you need to know your tables. These must be memorized. Multiplication is repeated addition though, so you can count by that number, and keep track of the number of times you counted to get to some target. That is the number required to multiply by the original number to reach that target. \n\nFor example, what is 3 * 8? Well, we either have it memorized, or we count by that number. Maybe 8 is too hard, so count by 3 eight times. 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24. And we know the answer is 24 because it took 8 jumps.\n\nIn division, you are repeatedly subtracting some value. If we do 24 / 3, we are subtracting 3 from 24 until it reaches zero. This is counting in reverse: 24 21 18 15 12 9 6 3 0. It again took 8 jumps.\n\nMemorize your multiplication tables. Just get a piece of paper, and write out in a grid:\n\n        2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    2\n    3\n    4\n    5\n    6\n    7\n    8\n    9\n\nAnd fill in the intersections.\n\nYou should make flashcards too. \n\nHopefully this helped.

If you owe 3 dollars, and pay with 10 dollars, then you must get 7 dollars back because 3+7=10, which you'll have memorized.\n\nYou can memorize differences too:\n\n    10-9=1\n    10-8=2\n    10-7=3\n    10-6=4\n    10-5=5\n\nBut see how these are saying the same things? Above you were getting sums of 10, and here you are calculating differences. \n\nAnyway, those are whole dollar amounts. So, let's consider a real scenario. Something costs $2.99 before tax. This is almost 3. And you know if you pay with a 10, you will get 7 dollars back for this purchase, except it still takes 1 penny to reach 3 on the original total, which means that you will get 7.01 back before tax. This isn't entirely useful though.\n\nTax isn't generally above 10%, but calculating for 10% is pretty easy. You just move the decimal over 1 to the left, and add that resultant total to your total. For our $2.99 purchase, the sales tax puts it at .299, which is almost 30. So, we add 30 cents to 3.00 to get 3.30, which is good enough for keeping track of our shopping.\n\nNow, we know that if we pay with a 10 for our 3.30 item, we get back less than 7 this time. We know 3+7 is equal to 10, so that means we get 6.70 back. This isn't important either because you haven't paid yet, but it's certainly opportunities to practice as you shop.\n\nOne thing to notice though is that I'm simplifying these values to make them easier to work out in my head.\n\nYou get to the register, and ring up several items totaling $17.38. You now have to pay with a $20. Again, 7+3=10, so your change is 3 something, except it's a little more than 7, so we subtract a dollar from 3 to get at least 2.

I am transgender myself, so I can give you examples that will hopefully be helpful.\n\nYou're right that it's like a mental discomfort. Experiences really do vary - it honestly does depend on the person.\n\nGenerally, people define common experiences of dysphoria as things like:\n\n\"I never fit in with the girls/boys at primary school\"\n\n\"when I started puberty I started to hate my body\"\n\n\"I always prayed that I would wake up a girl/boy/different\"\n\nIt's always that kind of thing. But those are quite *vague*; they're more like general categories we can slot dysphoric moments into. Social, physical, mental. \n\nBut they're a really unhelpful description of dysphoria, and they cause a lot of confusion, cis and trans alike. When I was starting to figure out that I was trans, I can't say these helped me an awful lot. \n\nAnd that's because they're not specific, they don't actually *describe* moments of dysphoria, or at the very least, they're stereotypical descriptions of dysphoria that only fit a certain quantity of people. Not everyone will have these, and if these are the only experiences of dysphoria people see described, it remains as unhelpful as ever. \n\nIt's like how some people think that in order to be transgender, you have to have known from a *very* young age, *always* wanted to present differently, kicked up a fuss at having your birth gender foisted upon you, and started transitioning at precisely the age of 12. \n\n(Interestingly, these stereotypes always rely on the parents sharing their experiences of having A Different Kid, kind of like how you see autism discussed through the lense of the parent, never the child. Make of that what you will. No, make of that the fact that it takes away the autonomy of the child, and places their transition and acceptance in the hands of the parents - \"we struggled with our kid but eventually we broke down and realised wow i guess i can accept my child\" like it's something special or they deserve an award.\n\n(What happens when this doesn't happen? Who focuses on the children who don't have parents who accept them? Why are children with accepting parents treated like lucky outliers? I'll take society's-freak-show-outlook-on-trans-people for 500, Alex)\n\nSharing my experiences of *precise* dysphoric moments should clear things up a bit, hopefully. Here's some:\n\n- As a kid, I always felt drawn to the boys. Wanted to be friends with them, hang out with them, feel equal to them (didn't realise the last bit at the time). Wasn't a matter of \"being a tomboy\"; to this day I don't really have super manly interests, aside from having an appreciation for classical architecture and woodworking. It was on a deeper level, like it just felt *right* that I would be friends with the boys, like I was one of them. I felt more confident talking to the guys. It was like a deep-seated, intrinsic understanding that that was the side of the fence I was from. Kid me never even put it into words, really. Kid me just *knew*.\n\n- My brother used to have his mates over, and I always wanted to play with them. I wanted to play with my brother, but I wanted to be mates with his mates, too; kids used to tease me that I had a crush on this one guy. I didn't. I wanted to be friends. There was one occasion where he said \"he's my friend, not yours\", and that crushed me, or at least, I remembered it, and still do. I couldn't understand why I couldn't be friends with him, when I knew I belonged to be friends with the guys. \n\n- We put on a nativity show in primary school, as you do when you live in a town with 8 churches, and there was a song in it about lil tiny JC and his mum. There was a part where I had to mime holding a baby and I hated it. Intrinsically hated being put in a motherly role. Felt wrong. Couldn't put it into words but it felt wrong and it felt degrading and it felt embarassing. I hated the thought that everyone was looking at me in this role. As I remember, I simply crossed my arms instead. I just *would* not do it. Never liked dolls, either, though that could be miscontrued as \"you were a tomboy\"; I *had* barbies, and I loved dressing them up, but I just had no connection to the thought of being a mother some day.\n\n- Skip forward to high school and for prom I went all out. Kinda went with \"maybe if I go SUPER femme then this'll fix all this who-am-I shit and everythin'll slot into place and all that jazz hahah no identity crisis here no siree\". Full 50s prom dress, hair up, makeup (that i shoulda done myself woulda turned out better sorry hairdresser who did it for me), genuine vintage shoes, all the jazz. *all* the jazz. didn't work. felt like I was wearing a costume, *every* attempt at fitting into some kind of \"I'm a woman\" role felt like a costume, and I left thinking I should've cut my hair short and worn a suit instead\n\n- There was a moment, walking to another lesson, where I caught sight of my body - my alright, 8st 2lb body - in the mirror, and thought \"fuck, what an embarassing mess\", or emotions to thereabouts. My chest just looked like an embarassment, not because it was too small, but because it was embarassing that it was even *there*\n\n- I could never really picture what I looked like, *fully*, in my head? I knew logically the bits and pieces were there. I knew what bits of my face looked like, I knew what my hair was like, but mentally the pieces never fell in together. It's like the end result would have been upsettingly dysphoric - recognising that I had a feminine body - so my brain decided to just up and nope out of it. A couple of weeks after I got my hair cut short (which felt like the best moment of my life in a way I can't even describe), I couldn't picture myself with long hair again, so I guess in an effort to not feel bad my body decided it didn't want to know\n\nEventually I figured that no matter what version of femininity, no matter what kind of mask I put on of \"I could be X\", none of em would be true. The issue wasn't that I hadn't found my style, or my chest wasn't big enough, or that I was insecure, it was that I just *couldn't* function like a normal human being without transitioning, because I'd be interacting with the world through a filter without that happening. \n\nI'd be wearing a mask every single day of my life, always wondering why my body was an embarassment, why I didn't know what I looked like fully in a mirror, why I couldn't interact with people honestly. I dissassociated because being physically present in the wrong name, pronouns and body was embarassing and upsetting, so the bigger the wall I built, the less I had to deal with it. It was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nIt's like having to put on a mask that supresses who you are and strips you naked at the same time, every single day, living in the closet. Living out of the closet is better, but I still hate my voice, and being misgendered, and being unable to wear earrings without being called 'she'.", "score": 41, "likes": 0, "upvote": 41, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "witnge", "id": "e5cntbf", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9ckumr/what_is_something_you_genuinely_do_not_understand/e5cntbf/", "content": "I'm sorry you feel the way you feel.\n\nDo you think if society didn't have such strong gender roles you'd still be uncomfortable being misgendered as female?\n\nI'm a cisgender woman and can relate to a lot of what you describe growing up.

Thinking in a deep and philosophical manner (i.e. what makes me a particular gender?) has been unhelpful and hard to answer.

That alone doesn't make me a man; plenty of women wear men's clothing. I stopped shaving my body hair because it made me feel more comfortable, which also doesn't by itself make me trans. Having breasts makes me extremely uncomfortable, which, again, some cis (cis=not trans, it is not pejorative) women feel. To treat that symptom I wear a binder, and I would like a double mastectomy because wearing a binder is very uncomfortable, it's just better than the alternative. This would be considered abnormal for a cis woman, but it alone does not make me trans.  I would like a deeper voice and facial hair, so I will take testosterone when I get a doctor's approval. I like the way being more muscular feels, so I work out, and look forward to being on testosterone because it will make that easier. And gee, I frighten children when I use the women's restroom now, it would certainly make more sense to have society call me a man. I realized all of this bit by bit, then looked at the whole picture and went \"oh fuck I guess I'm trans\". It wasn't a grand realization, but a series of decisions and preferences over my entire life.\n\n\nIt also might be helpful to try and empathize with trans people who actually share your gender (ie think about how it would feel to be assigned female at birth and develop female sex characteristics and want what you have now).

But I did have a big change of thought regarding it after getting to know a few trans people.\n\n\u200b\n\nAbout 10 years ago, when I was in my late teens, I was part of a pretty tight-knit online community. One person, who I talked to almost every night, came out to me as trans. At the time, transgender was still just a word I had only heard a handful of times. I didn't really know the difference between it and transsexual, transvestite, drag queen, etc. I did know that I had seen it in the livejournal community, and I had seen people kind of deride it as one of those \"special snowflake\" things on other parts of the internet. At the time I wondered if my friend, who I had talked about \"straight, female\" things with so many times was *really* one of those trans people, or if they just wanted to be artsy or different or something. I thought transgender was a *choice*, like getting a tattoo or dying your hair.\n\n\u200b\n\nOver the years I've grown to have several of my closest friends, by chance, be trans. I've had conversations with a few of them about various aspects of it, and have watched them go through expensive surgeries to remove organs that made them feel dysphoric. How could someone possibly go through the trouble of spending their life savings on something because they wanted to be a \"special snowflake\"? I realized that just as I cannot possibly imagine not feeling *female*, they cannot imagine feeling the gender that they were assigned at birth. Even if they didn't always know what trans was or that they were trans, they knew *something* was horribly off about them and when they learned about trans it just clicked for them. It felt right for them. It would be exactly like if I were in a man's body, but was still *me,* a woman who enjoys living the life of a woman.

It's about this case of twin boys where at one years old, one twin suffered a circumcision accident and his penis was cut off.

It follows David through his childhood being raised as a gender he didn't identify with and ultimately transitioning to male once he realized the truth of his early childhood. His story is quite tragic but I think if it's hard to get into the mind of a transgender person and empathize with their motivations, David's story may resonate more to you as a cis person. To me, both David's story and transpeople are similar in that they are socialized through adolescence with a gender they don't identify with and figuring out their place in society. David's case was inappropriately used for decades as justification to force sex surgeries on intersex children under the assumption that gender identity was learned and everyone is born as a blank slate. We now have a better understanding both because of David's case (once it was revealed the psychiatrist lied about him), intersex activism, and transgender people that gender identity is more complicated and deeply rooted in us that we can't quite understand.

I'm not super into it but some of my friends are. It's a combination of two things IMO. \n\nFirst off is that \"normal\" medicine can be totally useless and have awful side effects. Many people have the experience of going from doctor to doctor, spending all their money on treatment after treatment for some chronic condition that was never improved or cured and suffering under significant side effects. Some people have had unnecessary treatments and even unnecessary surgeries. This reduces their confidence in the medical system and makes them (rightly IMO) question the wisdom of many medical professionals. Sometimes doctors go on an ego trip and act like dictators even though they might not have any idea WTF they're doing. \n\nThe second part is that many of us have seen so called alternative medicine be accepted into the mainstream. Even today you can find doctors who will say marijuana has no legitimate medical use, and that was absolutely the norm 20 years ago, but it's pretty obvious that it has big effects in pain relief, seizure reduction, that kind of thing. Or for another example, look at dietary suggestions over the last 40 years and you can tell that they are always changing and easily influenced by lobbying (a clear example is how they used to tell everyone to drink milk all the time and avoid dietary cholesterol and far while ignoring sugar as the main culprit of dietary health issues). What was once on the fringe of dietary science has been embraced by the mainstream eg dietary cholesterol is not important at all. \n\nAdditionally, it's very clear if you follow nutrition science at all that many studies are done poorly. This makes it easy to convince conspiracy minded people that they're being done poorly on purpose for some financial reason. In fact I would suggest that it even happened with regards to sugar.\n\nOverall it's the failures of mainstream medicine and the egos of some doctors that have caused it IMO. Because of these factors people into alternative medicine feel that they're just ahead of the curve, not unscientific.", "score": 18, "likes": 0, "upvote": 18, "downvote": 0, "comments": []}]}, {"author": "MedRogue", "id": "e5c61nm", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9ckumr/what_is_something_you_genuinely_do_not_understand/e5c61nm/", "content": "Holocaust deniers . . .

You choke from something getting lodged in your \"windpipe\", or having something stuck in your esophagus so high up that is blocks the windpipe as well. This is exceptionally rare. If something gets stuck in your esophagus, it is terrifying the first few times. You can't swallow your own spit for potentially hours, can't get it up from puking, and it feels super uncomfortable. Trying to drink anything is a bad idea because it won't go down and then you could potentially inhale the liquids when it comes up. Incredibly tiny sips of water can help force it down, but the act of swallowing hard is scary because you think it'll make you unable to breathe (it can't and won't). If something gets lodged in your throat, try to take unfathomably small sips of water, or try puking it up. Might take a half hour of dry heaving, but usually works. If that's too scary, go to the hospital. They can either push it down, or wait til it passes.
