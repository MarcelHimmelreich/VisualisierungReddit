It's very important to identify the specific area of the pain. If it's on top of the scapula, underneath, or out toward the shoulders, (often because of an old sports injury), you're fine. But if the pain is *between the shoulderblades*, then you should understand what's going on, because the solution is likely NOT to massage it, because what's hurting is likely the **rhomboids**. \n\nThe rhomboids are straplike muscles that connect the rear edge of the scapula to the spinal column. If you roll your shoulders forward, you're pulling them taut. If you stay in this posture too long, they can start hurting because of chronic stretching. This is the case with pain between the shoulderblades a good 9 times out of 10.\n\nMassaging directly on the pain is a no-go. It might feel good right away but the pain will keep coming back, quickly and often worse. What you're doing is relaxing the already-strained rhomboids which then allow themselves to be pulled even tighter by the bullying pectorals or bad posture. The better approach to more long-term and satisfying pain relief is to massage the pectorals to relax/lengthen them and take pressure off the rhomboids. You're literally massaging the chest to relieve pain on the back. Teaching better posture will help too.\n\nIf the client doesn't know what's going on, it's a good idea to do a little frou-frou relaxation rubbing to the rhomboids after you've gotten deep in the chest, to make them think you're addressing the issue. I've had clients think I was magic because I spend like 1 minute between the shoulderblades and fix it better than anyone else they've had.\n\nThe reason this happens is that many, many of our activities shorten the pecs and very few lengthen them. Office desk workers and bodybuilders are especially vulnerable to this; office workers because they hunch over all day with their shoulders rolled forward, and bodybuilders because they actively work out the pecs, causing a disparity of strength between the chest and back. \n\nOf course it's not always like this. I worked on a guy who complained of pain between the shoulderblades. But when I asked him what he did for a living (expecting the usual), he said he was in a choir and spent hours with his shoulders pulled *back*, chest forward (to open up the chest cavity for maximum air flow), which is exactly the opposite - working out the rhomboids. In that case, working between the shoulderblades *is* correct.\n\nYou're also very right that there are a TON of muscles around the scapula. Though, if you compartmentalize them by function it's a little less complicated. There are the big ole erectors, muscles up and down the spine that keep us erect. Those are seldom a problem when it comes to upper back pain. There are the rhomboids, which are sort of independent and are very often involved, as previously discussed. There are a number of muscles in what we call the Scapular Sling, which usually only hurt because of sprains or injuries, particularly in sports.\n\nSo what's your SO's story/job/where does it hurt?", "score": 17, "likes": 0, "upvote": 17, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}]}]}]}, {"author": "ImpossiblePackage", "id": "e5ed7p3", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9cxf1g/how_can_you_describe_your_legal_legitimate_job_so/e5ed7p3/", "content": "This just made me realize that while prostitution is illegal, teaching somehow how to be a good prostitute is not.", "score": 82, "likes": 0, "upvote": 82, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "bunonafun", "id": "e5eee61", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9cxf1g/how_can_you_describe_your_legal_legitimate_job_so/e5eee61/", "content": "now open: bunonafun\u2019s prostitute school", "score": 41, "likes": 0, "upvote": 41, "downvote": 0, "comments": []}]}, {"author": "Sharkhazard91", "id": "e5eeyva", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9cxf1g/how_can_you_describe_your_legal_legitimate_job_so/e5eeyva/", "content": "I was trying to come up with one for a massage therapist.

I was given a medical check, a Subway sandwich, and outdoor equipment before being taken by SUV into the middle of the high desert. I was told, \"Group 9, that's the good group, they have ATVs and bigger cabins, plus a basketball court\". \n\nThis was a lie. There were no ATVS or cabins, anywhere we went, we walked with dozens of pounds on our backs, and anywhere we slept was under a small, crinkly blue tarp. There was no basketball. The games we played involved big booties of varying numbers, heads in an up or down position with pressed thumbs, and goose-chasing as timid ducks watch on.\n\nStarting in early November, the high desert is where I hiked, slept, and talked about feelings until late January. \n\nThey took my big toenails, which returned, twisted and corrupted.

I study stars in outer space to learn more about them.  More specifically, I study very big stars, many times bigger than the sun, that explode after they run out of fuel and die in the biggest explosions we know of, called a supernova!  One supernova is so bright the light from it can outshine the rest of the billions of other stars in the galaxy it's located in!\n\nWhen a supernova happens, it emits not just light, but other kinds of radiation too.  The supernova also releases a giant shockwave that can travel thousands of miles (or kilometers, if a non-American six year old) every *second*, which will hit everything around the star as it shoots outwards for hundreds of years.  The shockwave hitting this material gives off radio waves, and this is what I study!  I want to answer questions like: how does a supernova change outer space around it?  Can we learn something about the stuff that the shockwave is hitting?  And can that stuff around the star, if it was released by the star before it died, tell us about how the star exploded?\n\nSupernovas are very cool, but they don't happen very often- maybe only once every hundred years or so in a galaxy the size of the Milky Way.  The last one we saw in the Milky Way was in 1604, before the invention of the telescope!  So, maybe we will not see one for many more years.  But maybe, just maybe, the light from a supernova is speeding to Earth now, and will arrive tonight!

I'm not really sure of the inner workings of the mind but I was afraid that he might develop delusions. So maybe not everyone who exposes compulsive liars want to get even with the liar.

When he arrived, he entered the monk's home to take all of his valuables. The monk apologized, and said that he had nothing of value for him to offer. The thief looked around the room and realized it was empty; no statues, no gold, no riches. Just the monk.\n\nThe thief left, disappointed. As he walked down the road he heard footsteps behind him. It was the monk: 'I have nothing to give you, except for this', and it was the clothes, right off his back. The thief seemed confused, and walked away into the night, taking the monk's clothes with him. The monk looked up at the sky and said, 'Poor man. I wish I could give him the moon'. \"\n\nI still have a long way to go, as we all do. I had a real good sweet spot of being a genuine and good person at the end of high school.

He told me I must either really dislike him or have a crush on him (it was the latter); otherwise he didn't understand why I would treat him that way.\n\nI was so shocked and ashamed.

The best kind of apology is 1) private - you don't want it to seem like you're putting on a show for others to see and 2) not asking for forgiveness - this is about you apologizing, not making yourself feel better. If you offer an apology and someone says \"yeah, thanks for admitting it, but it doesn't change the fact that you hurt me a lot\" then you just have to accept that and move on. Pressing for forgiveness and acceptance will only make them feel worse - like you hurt them and now it's their burden to put it behind them.

I had this stupid idea that I was constantly in competition with everyone around me \u2013 especially when it came to creative endeavors \u2013 and I felt like the only way that I could get ahead was to sabotage my peers.\n\n------\n\n\"Hey, Max,\" someone might ask me, \"if I'm trying to write 'each day,' is it 'every day' or 'everyday?'\"\n\n\"Oh, it's 'everyday,' the one-word version,\" I'd lie.\n\n\"Are you sure? I thought that was an adjective.\"\n\nAt that point, I'd make up some supporting \"evidence\" for my deception: \"It usually is, yes, but think of it like days of the week: There's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on... so for *all* of them, it's 'everyday.'\"\n\nIf I was feeling especially nasty, I'd also tell them that it was capitalized.\n\n------\n\nIf I'm honest, I'd say that the above behavior stemmed from something similar that I started into when I was a bit younger... and which I unfortunately see quite a few people still practicing:\n\n------    \n\"I think my boyfriend is cheating on me,\" a (female) friend might say.\n\n\"He probably is, then,\" I'd reply. \"You should secretly test him to find out.\"\n\n\"Really? How?\"\n\n\"Just, like, be as mean to him as possible,\" I'd suggest. \"If he reacts poorly, it's because he's cheating on you. Oh, and you should definitely have a one-night stand with me in order to punish him. It's the only way that he'll learn.\"\n\n------\n\nI'm ashamed to admit that I continued with this sort of thing until I was nearly twenty, finding small ways to give myself a perceived advantage by knocking other people down. Eventually, though, I realized the truth of things: That toxic behavior was prompted entirely by my own insecurity, along with my belief that I wouldn't be able to keep up with actual competitors. \n\nReally, it was just an excuse to stagnate, because I had reasoned \u2013 rationalized, more like \u2013 that if *everyone else* was either already working backwards or doing worse than me, then I'd never need to improve. After having that small epiphany, I made a conscious effort to turn myself around, and nowadays, I do whatever I can to offer genuine help whenever someone asks for it.\n\nAfter all, if we all focus on improving ourselves, then standards rise for everyone... and that process is a lot easier and more pleasant if we lend each other a helping hand along the way.\n\nOh, and just for the record: Your boyfriend probably isn't cheating on you, and \"every day\" is always two words when you mean \"each day\" or \"daily.\" That \"days of the week\" garbage was utter nonsense.\n\n**TL;DR: Anxious \"adult\" allots absolutely awful advice.**", "score": 19, "likes": 0, "upvote": 19, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "WorkAccountNANANA", "id": "e5e4eie", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9cwwdw/what_was_your_toxic_trait_and_what_motivated_you/e5e4eie/", "content": "I do this, but with absurdly obvious bad advice.\n\nMy coworker decided to IM me in all caps today.

One little law that I think would change my world for the better? Easy.\n\nAs a person in my late 40s, I'd decree that here in America, henceforth and forevermore, there would be a *maximum* age to be allowed to run for President of the United States, U.S. Senate, and the House of Representatives. We already have age minimums for politicians, so I feel maximums would only be fair. From that moment onward, nobody over the age of 70 could become President, or a representative. If they turn 70 *after* inauguration/swearing-in, they may take their seat but they may not run for re-election because they'll be past the maximum age.\n\nI believe that it's time we stopped having people past retirement age, who are out of touch with the way things are *right now*, making the decisions for people who are out here working and living their lives in the modern world, under modern rules. I think people over 70 are out of touch with anyone under 60, and that since the vast majority of people who will be directly affected by political choices are people from 18-50.\n\nBottom line: I'm sick of old white guys who think of things in terms of the 1940s & 1950s being in charge of what young Americans in 2017 can and cannot do, have, or become. \n\nA maximum age would change the face of America pretty quickly. No longer would we have career politicians who hang on to a political office-- or multiple offices-- until they're dead in their 90s or 100s, becoming more and more out-of-touch, more and more brain-addled, and more and more outdated by their cultural ideals which they refuse to adapt or change to reflect the times. \n\nIn my 5 minutes, I would ensure that NO MORE would we have to put up with representatives and leaders who are four, five, or even six decades older than the Americans in their prime. \n\nHaving done this, I would abdicate my throne and return America to the President... Who could now not run for re-election because he's too damned old. Likewise, Kerry, Clinton, and all those other old fucks would be out of a job come the next election. Bye, Felicia.

Your neighbor can\u2019t purchase your car because he really likes it or your property or anyone you know neighbors cousins friends relatives people close in protection to the kids or adults who share ownership on the property. Basically any person you know cannot be referred to purchase anything that may belong to you in protection of the families assets. Nobody close who may know family members who do so to damage or exchange wealth with intent to decrease it with negotiation whom harms the family monetarily. Anyone close or known person. With a secondary clause of forcing equal distribution with imprisonment of the families assets regardless of they share one mother or one father paid in cash and liquidated to settle issues on the run at the passing of the person who owns the title and to stop homelessness mental evaluations to families who kick people out of their house for any reason plus imprisonment if they did it because they felt like it and consequent higher punishment if the person is found homeless again two or three times for up to 25 years in jail. That would solve the homeless problem in America and the theft and the passing of wealth to following generations, where current generations are so needy their parents are dying with their pockets full giving their wealth to their neighbor, or have made so many mistakes selling their shit to their friends or neighbors to keep trying or true malice behind people purchasing your wealth and property that if they die their children only inherit debts and lies due to psychopathic envy or compulsive lying or malice and greed surrounding the family fortune. Where by majority it\u2019s all snakes who extort family members to take what\u2019s rightfully yours and over money they use the money and you never see a dime, making this I believe this money from selling this to a friend who wants it plus I think the money is just mine illegal. All you have to do is tell on the family member whom you think sold something, that belonged to the family and last name as a whole, sold something to a friend or didn\u2019t give you anything for it. That would also solve poverty significantly, families who make members who have 50 percent of their blood poor would be rightfully outlaws because it isn\u2019t a choice. And by majority it\u2019s choices like the stories of the Bible whom families prefer specific children to take what belongs to everyone with their last name. Whom through criminal mindset take it too the next level. To make sure to slander or treat like shit  1 or 2 of your kids as black sheep because you feel like it, for life just to give it to 1 person and convince everyone to do the same.
