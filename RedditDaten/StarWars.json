Loving a movie is fine, disliking a movie is also fine. As long as you voice your opinion in a civilized manner then all will be cool. What's not cool is being a dick to someone that doesn't share your opinion. Billy Joe hates TLJ, he has a right to hate it if he wants, that doesn't give you a pass to be a dick to Billy Joe just because you think TLJ should be a multi Oscar winner. But that door swings both ways, Billy Joe has no right to be a dick to others for disagreeing with him, as long as the disagreeing is done in a civilized way.\n\nThe toxicity ends now. If you can't converse in a civilized manner, then we don't want you here.\n\n\nSo in short, keep criticism constructive and keep responses to criticism constructive. \n\n\n\nOn a more positive note, we passed 900K subscribers recently.

Movies are objective. Movies are a different form of art, not like a painting. Which I judge objectively. It doesn't matter how I feel personally about the movie. These so called professional critics don't take into account various details about movies such as plot consistency between and character motivation from film to film.\n\nOne example being Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Regardless of whether the movie is good or bad, the whole movie is a plot hole. The curse that afflicted Davy Jones was meant to be broken after seeing his beloved at the shoreline after sailing the seas collecting souls. Calypso wasn't there for him so he remained cursed to the Dutchman. Now in At World's End during the after credits scene when Will Turner comes back he sees his beloved Elizabeth meaning the curse should be lifted. But in Pirates 5 it isn't. We all know the reason they ignore this is because they had different writers who didn't care, forgot, wouldn't have a story if they followed that, and it's also a cash grab. Basically the whole movie shouldn't happen but I doubt a professional critic would take that into account. And no I don't think that's nitpicky because this is a huge plot point. Might as well have a character who died in a previous film be alive again for no apparent reason. This is why I pay no mind to professional critics.\n\nIf movies aren't reviewed objectively in any way than one could easily say Avatar: The Last Airbender is a faithful and superb adaptation to the animated series. I enjoyed the hell out of that movie. It was hilarious and fun to watch. But I can recognize it is an absolute dumpster fire. Bad acting, poor casting, terrible choreography, butchering of the source material and even some bad visual effects plague this movie. One thing people often overlook from the surface is the fact that every character is an exposition piece. Not a single person acts like a human being. They only spout exposition, explaining the lore of the world and not acting like human beings. If every character in a movie is just an exposition piece than how can it possibly be a good movie?\n\nTLDR; movies are objective. It doesn't matter how you feel about them personally. I dislike many good movies and I enjoy many bad ones. I don't decide if they are good or not.

I only discussed objective portions of the film.\n\nThat false climax is exactly that. The main character with development is Rey, And after that point she becomes irrelevant to the story.  It is a false climax because it isn't just a 2nd act. The 2nd act is Rey in training and the Canto Blight stuff. In a normal film, the fight on the capital ship against the evil emperor, followed by a climactic duel between the 2 main characters is the climax. The heroes escaping Phasma also plays into that. But then it keeps on going.\n\nAs for canto blight, what character development? DJ certainly didn't change. Rose was still against it all and didn't learn anything new or different. And the neither does Finn. It doesn't contribute to the changes in his character that come at the end. Canto exists as a way to give Finn something to do. The prison arc doesn't contribute to the story.\n\nI don't know What You mean by my interpretation of Hyperspace. As shown in TFA, A precision jump within a planet's atmosphere is possible. It would be a lot easier to even get within a couple thousand kilometers ahead of the fleet. And you can't say they wouldn't know where to go, since due to the tracker they know exactly where they are. Doesn't matter how far ahead they ovwrshoot, simple geometry makes it a pincer.\n\nThere is also a problem in theme. It is supposed to be about saving what they love, But the major victories for the rebels come from destroying the First Order. The suicide bombing run to defeat the Dreadnought, Kylo assassinating Snoke, Holdo suicide ramming the Supremacy, etc.\n\nI never said the film was trashed, but it definitely isn't an objectively good film.

It\u2019s \u201cobjectively competent.\u201d  And yes, a movie with well defined character arcs, coherent action, special effects that aren\u2019t jarring, widely praised performances, and cinematography of its caliber is definitively competent.  Everything beyond that is in the realm of the subjective.\n\nTo help you out with the 3 act thing: the first two acts are our heroes learning lessons.  Rey learns about the nature of the Force and is forced to accept her unremarkable parentage, Poe learns to be a more pragmatic leader and value lives over the visceral thrill of glory on the battlefield, Finn learns why the Resistance is so important and commits himself fully to it after a film and a half of wavering, and Luke learns the importance of failure and moving past it.  The third act is the heroes putting these lessons into practice.  Rey becomes a hero in her own right and not because of any special connections, Poe prioritizes keeping the Resistance alive above \u201cwinning\u201d the Battle of Crait, Finn is willing to lay down his life for the cause, and Luke puts on an impressive display of the Force and sacrifices himself for the future of the Resistance.\n\nCanto Bight is where Finn finally learns to stand up to power.  In TFA, his desertion from the First Order is a personal decision.  But seeing the way commoners and animals are treated by the upper class he at first admired is a shock to his system.  After this he frees the Fathiers during his and Rose\u2019s escape, and says that their whole misadventure there was worth it if they could stick it to the man.  As for Rose and DJ not having character arcs... not every character in a movie will.  That\u2019s what separates movies from TV.\n\nAnd are you saying that Han and Chewie barely pulling off an insane maneuver in a small ship they are uniquely gifted at flying is the same thing as trying to position a fleet where it can intercept another fleet without giving up an advantageous position?  More to the point, why would the First Order risk this and waste their resources when they know they can just watch the Resistance fleet and wait for them to run out of fuel first?  They\u2019ve even taken out the Resistance fighters, so there\u2019s no means of retaliation.  In their minds, they\u2019ve already won, and they\u2019re just waiting to collect.  I don\u2019t know why so many people have trouble understanding this.\n\nAnd you have to *seriously* misread the film to come up with your interpretation of the way the theme is presented.  Poe leading the destruction of the Dreadnought is presented as a hollow victory and reckless, impulsive action.  He\u2019s immediately demoted.  Holdo ramming the First Order fleet is the only way she can think of to save the people she cares about.  It\u2019s a defensive action.  Her last words are, \u201cGodspeed, Rebels.\u201d  The film spells it out for you.  And Kylo killing Snoke is presented as a good thing at first, not because it\u2019s aggressive, but because Rey thinks Kylo is turning to the Light Side.  When this turns out not to be the case, it\u2019s clearly presented as a bad thing.  Rey cries.\n\nDon\u2019t get mad, but it seems like the film just didn\u2019t click for you, and then you looked online for justification.  Again\u2014 it\u2019s not that the film is objectively good.  The terms good and bad are subjective terms.

I don't know how you get past this.  Forgive me for a moment for bringing up Star Trek: I love both Star Trek and Star Wars, and tend to use one when talking about the other when I don't want to start a flamewar.\n\nSo opinion among Trekkies was highly divided after the 2009 J. J. Abrams vehicle.  I can see it; it's more of an action movie than even Wrath of Khan.  Other than First Contact, the TNG era wasn't action-oriented.  DS9 was drama-oriented.  Voyager was, well, Voyager, and Enterprise was Enterprise, and the new show tends to try to be all of the above, in between Enterprise and TOS.  Just calling yourself a \"Trekkie\" doesn't say anything about your fandom other than that you like Star Trek.  If one your favorite moments in Star Trek is Kruge yelling, \"GET OUT!  GET OUT OF THERE!!!\" as the Enterprise is about to self-destruct, you'll probably love the reboot.  If one of your favorite moments is instead Captain Sisko's closing monologue in \"In The Pale Moonlight\", you'll probably hate it.  \n\nThe problem comes in when  bunch of like-minded fans think they represent fandom.  It's one thing when you say, \"We don't like the way Chris Pine's Kirk acts so immature.\"  It becomes something else when you say, \"Chris Pine's Kirk is so immature.  It's insulting to the fans.\"  Well...is it? For the record, I love Sisko's closing monologue, but I don't feel insulted by Pine's Kirk.  Does that mean I'm not a fan?\n\nStar Wars deals with less of this because the universe is imho more cohesive, but I see some of that happening in Wars fandom, too.  There's people who refuse to like anything that isn't George Lucas.  Their loss, imho.  I can understand people not giving Clone Wars a chance because it's cartoony.  I get it.  I thought there were great moments but I get being too embarrassed to watch a cartoon as an adult.  I personally loved Rogue One but even I had problems with it.  I could see people who grew up during the Prequels era having a problem with it and the rest of the OT-era love.  What I won't do and I wish people would stop doing is looking at themselves and their friends and saying, hey, we represent average viewers (your probably don't) and therefore claim ownership over the thing you love.  I recently realized that I only really *love* one Star Wars movie, and just really like the rest largely because of that one movie.  That doesn't mean that anyone who unironically likes Attack of the Clones is a fake fan or whatever, it just means they have different likes and dislikes.\n\nSorry for the long rant but there it is.", "score": 8, "likes": 0, "upvote": 8, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}, {"author": "themitchster300", "id": "e26rliu", "url": "/r/StarWars/comments/8xy3c2/on_opinions/e26rliu/", "content": "I think this is a great idea, and a classy way to do things without flat out banning opinions.

George Lucas tried to do this with the prequels by exercising almost free creative control and they were not well received.  Rian Johnson tried to change the Star Wars formula and make it uniquely his own and we can see the immense backlash to that decision.\n\nThe success of Star Wars films comes when both those creating it and the fans realize the shared nature of the franchise and simply try to do it justice. We saw that with The Force Awakens which hewed pretty close to A New Hope as source material.  We saw that with Rogue One which was able to explore a new tone for the franchise but did so in a closed environment and still paid immense homage to the films which surrounded it.  \n\nIn short, I wish everyone treated the franchise with respect.

If I'm nitpicking, I thought Vader was maybe a little too chatty at times, and his tolerance for Thrawn's shenanigans towards the end maybe went a tad too far for Vader's character, but it was by no means bad. Vader flying a Defender and suggesting the improvements that we later see in Rebels was awesome. I also loved the subtle ways that Thrawn let on his awareness of Vader's identity. We knew it had to happen, and I thought it was handled a lot more cleverly than in Tarkin's book. Even though Anakin didn't come close to having the relationship with Thrawn that he had with Padme, Ahsoka, and Obi-Wan, Thrawn's \"I know\" moment to Vader still managed to hit me in the feels a little bit. He really respected the fuck out of Anakin.\n\nLoved the Chiss lore regarding their Benjamin Button-esque sensitivity to the Force.

I listened to the audiobook version performed by Marc Thompson and his work is always great. \n\n**Spoilers Ahead** I really enjoyed this novel and going into it was excited to see more Clone Wars era Anakin. I actually curbed my expectations and only expected a small amount to be dedicated to him but was pleasantly surprised the book seemed to be equally divided between eras. However, I did end up enjoying the \u2018Empire era\u2019  more due to the dialogue between Thrawn and Vader.  \n\nZahn seems very comfortable writing for both Anakin and Vader and does an excellent job at differentiating their personalities through speech patterns. Thrawn and Vader\u2019s back and forth had me holding my breath at times, and Thrawn carefully dances the line with Vader knowing full well what he is capable of. He also did an excellent job at showing how different, but equally effective, their leadership styles are. When they got down to it and were working together to accomplish a goal, I didn\u2019t want to set the book down. By the end of the book, when mutual respect had been established(for the most part, Vader still had doubts), and Vader leading a batch of Tie defenders on the attack and Thrawn at the helm of the Chimaera calling the shots and watching Vader\u2019s back, I was giddy. \n\nI knew going into it that part of the novel would deal with whether or not Thrawn knows that Anakin Skywalker was indeed Lord Vader, and I was not disappointed. I knew he would be quick to pick it up, and he kept pushing his buttons by bringing up old memories. By the end he had it figured out and at their final confrontation Vader made it clear to Thrawn that Anakin Skywalker was dead and to never mention his name again. \n\nSpeaking of Anakin, the Clone Wars plot was enjoyable as well. It was nice seeing Padme again, and Zahn did a good job of writing her character as well. She was pretty badass in this book and it\u2019s got me looking forward to er upcoming novel! Zahn made another call back from an older novel into canon with Cortosis ore. An element that can stop blaster fire and shut down Lightsabers on contact. \n\nGetting an insight into the Chiss Ascendency is awesome, and discovering their force sensitive children become pilots (\u201cSkywalkers\u201d) and they lose their force abilities with age is a neat revelation. In quite a few of the new novels we get to see how other cultures, races and planets treat force users and how they use their abilities and I find that intriguing. \n\nI know Zahn said he has Ideas for 3 more Thrawn novels, I really hope they let him write them!

Thrawn was almost always completely correct in his observations but other characters were pissed off both because he unintentionally came off as patronising and because those around him simply envied his intelligence. It was also quite funny how his bluntness in explaining his thoughts irritated other characters yet they couldn't disagree with him as they realised he was correct once they considered his reasoning. Sometimes however Thrawn deliberately pushed people's buttons and that was comical as well because he was so subtle yet so accurate when he chose to get under people's skin.\n\nTimothy Zahn created the Thrawn character but I feel this book was the absolute best character work Thrawn has had to date.

Everything was left by his father like the training program and the future of the First Order was in the gasp of Snoke.

I love how Zahn basically made the 7th Fleet top notch *and* human at the same time, Faro mentions a weapon's master is a \"mini-tyrant\" in her domain but even then isn't too bad. Will we see a \"cult-of-personality\" follow Thrawn? As in, the the Blood Crow, 96th Task force, 7th Fleet, Lothal Garrison, ect having people spread his legend. Thrawn *was* recruiting, maybe some hide in a new Empire of the Hand. (It's been proven as strong as he was, Snoke isn't 100% omnipotent, the Chiss are still out there IMO.)\n\nAlso something amazing to note, how when possible, Thrawn picks people who enhance his ability to lead as subordinates. Eli is insane at Supply Chain Management, can (barely) keep up with Thrawn mentally and importantly for Thrawn human culture**s**. Faro is a *very* competent commander, respects her people very well, and can see and *cultivate* useful skills in her people. Skerris is a link to Skystrike, which is due to Thrawn respecting pilots so much for his Defender project. \n\nDid anyone else catch *why* Anakin never saw Thrawn's pilot and Thrawn never mentions her? She was a child, he wouldn't bring her into the dangers of their mission! I loved that twist, and Zahn left it open to us to figure out why! \n\nZahn is held among my favorite writers honestly, for both maturity and no-nonsense writing while still being fun, along with JK Rowling and Arthur Canon Doyle. He also sets up so many possible side plots it's great. He makes the characters into people, not hobbled-together tropes. His books are next to Rick Riordan's for me for must *finish* now. \n\nThings I need to see: \n\n* How Thrawn meets Pelleaon\n\n* Faro getting a promotion so that she stay's in the galaxy to go look for Thrawn and Ezera\n\n* The Imperial Missile Boat (google it), Thrawn's Tie Defender Hunter from the game Tie Fighter\n\n* Starting work on the Tie Avenger as a cheaper Tie Defender alternate!\n\n* A cameo by Soontir Fel and the 181st. As and elite squadron, I feel they should have the Tie Avengers.\n\n*  A flashback story to give us more Eli and Thrawn \n\n* Thrawn having to posture around another Grand Admiral or a different Moff he isn't used to *cough* Zsinj *cough*", "score": 11, "likes": 0, "upvote": 11, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "RyeDraLisk", "id": "e4mhvcd", "url": "/r/StarWars/comments/97dl56/thrawn_alliances_by_timothy_zahn_discussion_thread/e4mhvcd/", "content": "holy shit, I never noticed the thing about Thrawn's navigator.

I'd take them to a film lab or a small-ish company that's dedicated to digitization.\n\nCheap print film like these Star Wars films were always going to fade. Film is always going to age, but if stored properly, modern film can last hundreds of years without losing any quality. Old film stored properly, about a hundred years.\n\nThe biggest issue is Vinegar Syndrome, where the film basically starts to eat itself. Once it starts, you can't stop it, but you can slow it down. You'd want to get your film off of the old metal reels, out of the metal film cans, and onto archival plastic cores and cans. Archival plastic cans actually let the film breathe, so as it ages and gives off vapors, the vapor can escape rather than let the film steep in it, allowing it to eat away at itself.\n\nSo outside of a climate controlled vault, the best place to keep your films is in the back of a closet.

I'm assuming the length of the film, size of the film, maybe quality, etc make it hard.

You'll also probably have a hard time getting any lab to transfer a commercial 35mm film due to copyright issues.\n\nIt could have a magnetic strip for sound, but more likely an optical sound track. We charge extra for sound, I'm not sure about other places. I'm not sure I've ever seen it advertised by the film labs, since they're primarily scanning the camera originals. Again, I don't think a lab will transfer your commercial films without a copyright release.\n\nI can't believe you saw the film available for $120!! Are you sure it wasn't 16mm? $120 is on the cheaper end for even 16mm features on 2 reels, 35mm would be on around 10@1000ft reels. I can't imagine someone selling it for that cheap, but some people don't know what they have. If you love it, and you ever see it for less than $500, I say snag it.\n\nI don't recommend projecting your home movies, but that's because those are literally one of a kind, but 8/S8 is also a much more flimsy format, they probably weren't stored properly, and if the average person tries to project them, they'll probably damage the film. So if you want to preserve your family films, don't project them and just pay a professional to do it. However, part of the fun of having a film print is projecting it!! I don't think you really have any (practical) options for getting a home 35mm projector, but if you have any 16mm, it's a lot of fun to watch. Maybe you could reach out to a local theatre. If you're in a big-ish city, someone should still have a 35mm projector, or even a university. Maybe you could organize a public screening of the film. There'd still be copyright issues, but the theatre would know how to get in touch with the studio and get the rights to screen it.\n\nIf you DM me I'll share my companies website. We do pretty much everything...but not 35mm motion picture film, however we can do 35mm still photos.

I'm not sure how to tell the difference, personally, so I've just been trusting all the people who say it's 35MM. I was able to snag 3/12 reels from someone who sold them to me at $120. The full one I found with all the reels was not selling at all, I saw through an ebay history site that they'd listed it like 3-4 times before it finally sold for roughly $120.\n\nThere were very few Last Unicorn reels ever made, and one guy bought them up when he was linked to the author to sell the frames individually so I was lucky to snag what I did.\n\nI've been lucky enough to pick up two trailers of the film, also 35mm, but those are only a few minutes long.

I've been looking for it since, I wish I'd thought to look a bit sooner and I could have had a great deal!! :(\n\nIf I am able to acquire the full film, I might just ask about projecting it at my local theatre, that's a great idea. I'm actually friends with someone who has officially licensed TLU merch, so I know they talk to the people who own the films rights. They might be able to help me with any copyright issues. :) I'm also near a college, so maybe I'll look into any clubs or groups there who can help me locally.\n\nYeah, I'll look into the Spectra Labs as somewhere to start, thanks so much! I hope that since I look twice a day on every place I can think of that I'll strike gold like the person who did last October had.
