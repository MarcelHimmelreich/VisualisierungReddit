Loving a movie is fine, disliking a movie is also fine. As long as you voice your opinion in a civilized manner then all will be cool. What's not cool is being a dick to someone that doesn't share your opinion. Billy Joe hates TLJ, he has a right to hate it if he wants, that doesn't give you a pass to be a dick to Billy Joe just because you think TLJ should be a multi Oscar winner. But that door swings both ways, Billy Joe has no right to be a dick to others for disagreeing with him, as long as the disagreeing is done in a civilized way.\n\nThe toxicity ends now. If you can't converse in a civilized manner, then we don't want you here.\n\n\nSo in short, keep criticism constructive and keep responses to criticism constructive. \n\n\n\nOn a more positive note, we passed 900K subscribers recently.

Movies are objective. Movies are a different form of art, not like a painting. Which I judge objectively. It doesn't matter how I feel personally about the movie. These so called professional critics don't take into account various details about movies such as plot consistency between and character motivation from film to film.\n\nOne example being Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Regardless of whether the movie is good or bad, the whole movie is a plot hole. The curse that afflicted Davy Jones was meant to be broken after seeing his beloved at the shoreline after sailing the seas collecting souls. Calypso wasn't there for him so he remained cursed to the Dutchman. Now in At World's End during the after credits scene when Will Turner comes back he sees his beloved Elizabeth meaning the curse should be lifted. But in Pirates 5 it isn't. We all know the reason they ignore this is because they had different writers who didn't care, forgot, wouldn't have a story if they followed that, and it's also a cash grab. Basically the whole movie shouldn't happen but I doubt a professional critic would take that into account. And no I don't think that's nitpicky because this is a huge plot point. Might as well have a character who died in a previous film be alive again for no apparent reason. This is why I pay no mind to professional critics.\n\nIf movies aren't reviewed objectively in any way than one could easily say Avatar: The Last Airbender is a faithful and superb adaptation to the animated series. I enjoyed the hell out of that movie. It was hilarious and fun to watch. But I can recognize it is an absolute dumpster fire. Bad acting, poor casting, terrible choreography, butchering of the source material and even some bad visual effects plague this movie. One thing people often overlook from the surface is the fact that every character is an exposition piece. Not a single person acts like a human being. They only spout exposition, explaining the lore of the world and not acting like human beings. If every character in a movie is just an exposition piece than how can it possibly be a good movie?\n\nTLDR; movies are objective. It doesn't matter how you feel about them personally. I dislike many good movies and I enjoy many bad ones. I don't decide if they are good or not.

I only discussed objective portions of the film.\n\nThat false climax is exactly that. The main character with development is Rey, And after that point she becomes irrelevant to the story.  It is a false climax because it isn't just a 2nd act. The 2nd act is Rey in training and the Canto Blight stuff. In a normal film, the fight on the capital ship against the evil emperor, followed by a climactic duel between the 2 main characters is the climax. The heroes escaping Phasma also plays into that. But then it keeps on going.\n\nAs for canto blight, what character development? DJ certainly didn't change. Rose was still against it all and didn't learn anything new or different. And the neither does Finn. It doesn't contribute to the changes in his character that come at the end. Canto exists as a way to give Finn something to do. The prison arc doesn't contribute to the story.\n\nI don't know What You mean by my interpretation of Hyperspace. As shown in TFA, A precision jump within a planet's atmosphere is possible. It would be a lot easier to even get within a couple thousand kilometers ahead of the fleet. And you can't say they wouldn't know where to go, since due to the tracker they know exactly where they are. Doesn't matter how far ahead they ovwrshoot, simple geometry makes it a pincer.\n\nThere is also a problem in theme. It is supposed to be about saving what they love, But the major victories for the rebels come from destroying the First Order. The suicide bombing run to defeat the Dreadnought, Kylo assassinating Snoke, Holdo suicide ramming the Supremacy, etc.\n\nI never said the film was trashed, but it definitely isn't an objectively good film.

It\u2019s \u201cobjectively competent.\u201d  And yes, a movie with well defined character arcs, coherent action, special effects that aren\u2019t jarring, widely praised performances, and cinematography of its caliber is definitively competent.  Everything beyond that is in the realm of the subjective.\n\nTo help you out with the 3 act thing: the first two acts are our heroes learning lessons.  Rey learns about the nature of the Force and is forced to accept her unremarkable parentage, Poe learns to be a more pragmatic leader and value lives over the visceral thrill of glory on the battlefield, Finn learns why the Resistance is so important and commits himself fully to it after a film and a half of wavering, and Luke learns the importance of failure and moving past it.  The third act is the heroes putting these lessons into practice.  Rey becomes a hero in her own right and not because of any special connections, Poe prioritizes keeping the Resistance alive above \u201cwinning\u201d the Battle of Crait, Finn is willing to lay down his life for the cause, and Luke puts on an impressive display of the Force and sacrifices himself for the future of the Resistance.\n\nCanto Bight is where Finn finally learns to stand up to power.  In TFA, his desertion from the First Order is a personal decision.  But seeing the way commoners and animals are treated by the upper class he at first admired is a shock to his system.  After this he frees the Fathiers during his and Rose\u2019s escape, and says that their whole misadventure there was worth it if they could stick it to the man.  As for Rose and DJ not having character arcs... not every character in a movie will.  That\u2019s what separates movies from TV.\n\nAnd are you saying that Han and Chewie barely pulling off an insane maneuver in a small ship they are uniquely gifted at flying is the same thing as trying to position a fleet where it can intercept another fleet without giving up an advantageous position?  More to the point, why would the First Order risk this and waste their resources when they know they can just watch the Resistance fleet and wait for them to run out of fuel first?  They\u2019ve even taken out the Resistance fighters, so there\u2019s no means of retaliation.  In their minds, they\u2019ve already won, and they\u2019re just waiting to collect.  I don\u2019t know why so many people have trouble understanding this.\n\nAnd you have to *seriously* misread the film to come up with your interpretation of the way the theme is presented.  Poe leading the destruction of the Dreadnought is presented as a hollow victory and reckless, impulsive action.  He\u2019s immediately demoted.  Holdo ramming the First Order fleet is the only way she can think of to save the people she cares about.  It\u2019s a defensive action.  Her last words are, \u201cGodspeed, Rebels.\u201d  The film spells it out for you.  And Kylo killing Snoke is presented as a good thing at first, not because it\u2019s aggressive, but because Rey thinks Kylo is turning to the Light Side.  When this turns out not to be the case, it\u2019s clearly presented as a bad thing.  Rey cries.\n\nDon\u2019t get mad, but it seems like the film just didn\u2019t click for you, and then you looked online for justification.  Again\u2014 it\u2019s not that the film is objectively good.  The terms good and bad are subjective terms.

I don't know how you get past this.  Forgive me for a moment for bringing up Star Trek: I love both Star Trek and Star Wars, and tend to use one when talking about the other when I don't want to start a flamewar.\n\nSo opinion among Trekkies was highly divided after the 2009 J. J. Abrams vehicle.  I can see it; it's more of an action movie than even Wrath of Khan.  Other than First Contact, the TNG era wasn't action-oriented.  DS9 was drama-oriented.  Voyager was, well, Voyager, and Enterprise was Enterprise, and the new show tends to try to be all of the above, in between Enterprise and TOS.  Just calling yourself a \"Trekkie\" doesn't say anything about your fandom other than that you like Star Trek.  If one your favorite moments in Star Trek is Kruge yelling, \"GET OUT!  GET OUT OF THERE!!!\" as the Enterprise is about to self-destruct, you'll probably love the reboot.  If one of your favorite moments is instead Captain Sisko's closing monologue in \"In The Pale Moonlight\", you'll probably hate it.  \n\nThe problem comes in when  bunch of like-minded fans think they represent fandom.  It's one thing when you say, \"We don't like the way Chris Pine's Kirk acts so immature.\"  It becomes something else when you say, \"Chris Pine's Kirk is so immature.  It's insulting to the fans.\"  Well...is it? For the record, I love Sisko's closing monologue, but I don't feel insulted by Pine's Kirk.  Does that mean I'm not a fan?\n\nStar Wars deals with less of this because the universe is imho more cohesive, but I see some of that happening in Wars fandom, too.  There's people who refuse to like anything that isn't George Lucas.  Their loss, imho.  I can understand people not giving Clone Wars a chance because it's cartoony.  I get it.  I thought there were great moments but I get being too embarrassed to watch a cartoon as an adult.  I personally loved Rogue One but even I had problems with it.  I could see people who grew up during the Prequels era having a problem with it and the rest of the OT-era love.  What I won't do and I wish people would stop doing is looking at themselves and their friends and saying, hey, we represent average viewers (your probably don't) and therefore claim ownership over the thing you love.  I recently realized that I only really *love* one Star Wars movie, and just really like the rest largely because of that one movie.  That doesn't mean that anyone who unironically likes Attack of the Clones is a fake fan or whatever, it just means they have different likes and dislikes.\n\nSorry for the long rant but there it is.", "score": 8, "likes": 0, "upvote": 8, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}, {"author": "themitchster300", "id": "e26rliu", "url": "/r/StarWars/comments/8xy3c2/on_opinions/e26rliu/", "content": "I think this is a great idea, and a classy way to do things without flat out banning opinions.

George Lucas tried to do this with the prequels by exercising almost free creative control and they were not well received.  Rian Johnson tried to change the Star Wars formula and make it uniquely his own and we can see the immense backlash to that decision.\n\nThe success of Star Wars films comes when both those creating it and the fans realize the shared nature of the franchise and simply try to do it justice. We saw that with The Force Awakens which hewed pretty close to A New Hope as source material.  We saw that with Rogue One which was able to explore a new tone for the franchise but did so in a closed environment and still paid immense homage to the films which surrounded it.  \n\nIn short, I wish everyone treated the franchise with respect.

I've had this conversation a number of times with people, but I'm always happy to discuss. Please keep in mind that this is just my opinion, and obviously I mean you no personal offense. We're all fans, and we can all like and dislike whatever we want.\n\nBasically, I knew as soon as I read Vector Prime that I wasn't going to like the Vong. They're too grim and edgy and \"we wear hooks in our faces because pain brings us closer to god,\" like something from Warhammer 40k had unlawful carnal knowledge of a Klingon and then abandoned the baby. I also dislike biotechnology, just in general. I disliked their kryptonite-like immunity to the Force and all their goofily named oogly-booglies and dolphin basalts. I dislike everything about them, fairly intensely, and they didn't feel like they meshed well with Star Wars, at all.\n\nBut that's just a personal opinion. Here's why I think the Vong really deserve to be put in the ground and never taken out: the nature of them, the very core of them, is that they are a massive extragalactic threat on a scale our heroes have never seen before. Now, on a surface level, that's partially a problem just because it's DBZ-like power escalation as narrative, and that paints the universe into a corner quickly. What color is Goku's hair now, anyway? Pink? Blue? What does it even mean anymore?\n\nBut the real problem is that, like all invasive species of weeds, they choke out all other growth around them. If the core of the Vong story is that the entire galaxy is under threat and pushed back to their very limits, then no other storylines can reasonably happen. Every character should be dealing with the Vong in some way. The enormous living galaxy of Star Wars, where the cantina made it seem like you could choose to follow any of those characters and they'd have their own separate life, suddenly becomes about this one thing that isn't even that interesting or Star Wars-y. Everyone's storyline has to be about grief and pain and death and hooks in their faces.\n\nSo I went from reading every single Star Wars book that came out for like fifteen years in a row, to reading five of the NJO books and then just giving up. I had no hope that anything I was interested in would ever come out in the foreseeable future. The Vong literally choked me out of Star Wars novels, which younger me would have assured you was impossible. I mean, I read Crystal Star and The Courtship of Princess Leia, how much worse could it get? Worse. It could get worse.\n\nSo I don't want that to happen again. The Vong, by the very nature of their existence, narrow the galaxy to a single, boring thing. That's abhorrent to me now that I've paid the price of losing the EU already to get rid of them in the first place. I desperately, desperately hope that they stay dead and buried with Trioculus and the Sun Crusher and all the other ill-considered parts of the EU I loved so much.", "score": 18, "likes": 0, "upvote": 18, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "IdiotsLantern", "id": "e5f8v9y", "url": "/r/StarWars/comments/9d0byn/my_mara_jade_skywalker_from_dragoncon/e5f8v9y/", "content": "(applause) \n\nThis sums up a lot of my problems with the Vong right here.

For me, after reading almost all the bantam books that came before it was a welcome change in tone.  I liked the feel that there was some real danger in the books and that hero's could actually be affected.\n\nIn regards to in universe power creep, you're actually wrong about this.  It's taken pretty much for granted and even said in universe that if the vong had attacked during the empire, they would have been crushed.  They're only able to succeed in the way they do because of the disunity and chaos throughout the galaxy.\n\nI do get what you're saying about how this means that being across the galaxy can't be getting on with their own stories because of the vong war, but that doesn't really bother me at all.
