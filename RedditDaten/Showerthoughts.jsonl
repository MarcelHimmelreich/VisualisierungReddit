I didn't want to do it, no one in the whole goddamn office wanted to do it, but readers want to know what happened and rookie's get all the shit stuff. The only thing I could do was be as respectful as possible.\n\nIt was probably one of the most interesting experiences I've had in a long time.

Getting out old picturebooks, telling old stories, lot's of crying, anger,... but also a sort of... catharticism. They talked and talked, letting it all out. No barriers, no filters, just an open-hearted conversation with a complete stranger.\n\nThey just told me their son's story, and I wrote it down exactly as they wanted. Somewhere in the back of my mind I hope I indirectly did some good for them. Getting their story out, sharing their grief but also their pride for their son who was no longer a part of the world. \n\nI'm not saying there aren't plenty of shit journalists out there, because there are, but every story is a shade of grey.

Almost nothing from the E3 2011 showing (when it won 85 e3 awards) was in the final release, just 18 months later.\n\nVideo game development does not work much like film development. In a film a script might be written and rewritten for years between a screenwriter and a director/producer, but then shot in 30-90 days without a lot of changes. In a game everything gets changed all the time because you don't know how the gameplay is going to *feel* until you have a lot of assets made. Then as you tweak the gameplay you need to rework the assets, and as you start to run it on dev kits you need to rework it again, then your testers say that some minor part of the game is way more fun than the intended gameplay loop and *everything* gets reworked to fit that and boom, you have an entirely different game.\n\nStanley Kubrick once said that he wouldn't start filming until he knew how every single second of the film was going to look and sound, like how a chess master doesn't make a move until he knows how they are going to win.

It's because those side water tiles were wild encounter tiles but didn't have any information associated with them, so it ends up using whatever encounter information was used last. The \"Old Man\" teaching you the encounter copies your character's name temporarily to that specific location so you end up with some goofy shit based on your character's name, including pokemon like 'MISSINGNO.\" which would result in the duplication of one of your bag items.\n\nBut, That is not all. The glitch meant you would also see some other Pokemon based on your name. My usual Game name would cause me to see Level 168 Porygons, for example. More recently I sculpted a name for my Pokemon red Cartridge which let's me see Wild Mewtwo in the same way. I had some other Pokemon in mind but I forgot what they were, I'll let it be a surprise once I get there.\n\nBut- There's more.\n\nIt uses the last \"encounter\" information that was set, right?\n\nAnd you know how some pokemon are exclusive to the Safari zone?\n\nNot wasting my time with that game of chance.

So the empty bottle will show minutes for a full dripping bottle. Calculate how many bottles you need for a day.

The older gentleman confesses that he is unable to pay, and that he\u2019s sorry for letting the farce drag on. He is humiliated in front of the other members of the club and voluntarily leaves. But before doing so, the silent man grabs hold of him with tears in his eyes, and shows him a written message, still having not spoken a word even though his time was up.

But I do have a couple hall of Famers.\nI\u2019m a special education teacher, so I deal with kids with all kinds of physical, emotional and academic disabilities. I took care of a little girl once who had a number of complications due to spina bifida. Her mother couldn\u2019t be bothered to take care of her. The little girl wore diapers and was cath\u2019d. She required 3-5 diaper changes a day. Mom would only send 5 diapers a week. The thing is, she was getting full services from her community, so she was being provided with plenty of supplies. We suspect Mom was probably selling the extras. I ended up just buying her diapers. \nMom would not change her catheter regularly. We would change her out at school, but other than that she\u2019d go another 24 hours before a change out. Longer, if it was a weekend. The smell from the infections she\u2019d get after a weekend was horrendous. \nShe had lice constantly, and oozing bed bug sores. Mom told us to \u2018f off\u2019 when we\u2019d call and tell her to take her to a doctor. Found out later in the year that she also had scabies. We offered to administer the medications and creams at school. Mom told us to go to hell. \nGirl would come to school in men\u2019s underwear, xxl shirts and size 16 pants. She was 8. Finally discovered that her 9 year old sister was changing her diapers and dressing her everyday, and sister couldn\u2019t find any other cleanish clothes to put on her. Moms response \u201cI\u2019m busy. I have to get to work in the mornings.\u201d \nFinal straw was when the nurse discovered what appeared to be STD warts while changing her diaper one day. Nurse made (for the 10th time) another CPS report, but principal insisted that we call home and report our findings. Grandma found out, tipped off Mom, and Mom appeared at the school 15 minutes later, snatched up the kids and disappeared. Investigators showed up 15 minutes later, but Mom was already long gone.

I.e. visiting a friend's house on Saturday, weren't allowed to do anything on Sunday except clean or do yard work. \n\n5. Not allowed to argue with parents. Mom has a personality disorder and constantly lies. Dad always backs her up. She will lie about what the boys were doing and say they were breaking a rule when they weren't and they couldn't argue.

I was playing video games with him and after I got rekt in a particular game, I exclaimed \"Aw man, what the hell?!\" My friend and his little brother both froze in terror after that and the little brother ran out of the room fast.\n\nI asked my friend what was up and he said very meekly, \"We're not allowed to swear...\"\n\nThe little brother came back and sat down, followed closely by some very loud stomping footsteps. My friend's mom came in the room and said \"SoupyWolfy! Did you just swear?! There is ABSOLUTELY no swearing in this house! Do I make myself clear?!\"\n\nI was in 4th grade which is around the age that you learn all the swear words and use them a lot because you think it's cool to swear. I was even on the fence on if \"hell\" was even a swear or not, but I let it slide and said, \"Yes ma'am. I'm sorry.\"\n\nA little while later dinner was ready, so they called us to the dining room to eat. On the way over, I passed through the living room and saw a really big crazy looking sculpture. I pointed and asked, \"What the heck is that?\"\n\nAgain I was met with the deafening silence as my friend looked at me with his mouth agape.\n\n\"SOUPYWOLFY!!\" His mother exclaimed from the dining room. \"That's it! You're outta here! I told you, *no swearing!*\"  \nPerplexed I replied, \"What?! I didn't swear! I said *heck*, not *hell*!\"  \nThat set her off even more. \"Heck is a swear word too, and since you're not respecting our rules then you need to leave!\"  \n\nSo, I walked home and was never allowed back at their house. I stopped being friends with the kid since it was already a bit of a stretch based on how goody-goody he was.\n\nA few years later when I was in 8th grade, I finished my tennis practice after school and I was leaving the school to walk home. I lived about 3/4ths of a mile away. The kid was sitting outside of school on the bench and he was quietly crying to himself.\n\nSince he was crying, I walked over to him and said, \"Whoa, hey Tom, what's going on man, are you alright?\"  \nIn between gasps of tears he said, \"My mommy is supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where she iiiiiiiiis!\"  \n\"What time was she supposed to pick you up?\"  \n\"4:00\". It was 4:30 which meant he was on this bench for half an hour.  \n\"Well, come on, you can walk with me. Your house is just a few blocks past mine. I walk home every day, it's no problem.\"  \n\"I caaaaaaan't!\" He was still crying and made these long gaspy cries when he talked.  \n\"Why not? Sure you can! It'll take like 15 minutes and you'll be home, no problem. Come on!\"  \n\"I'm not allowed toooooooooo!\" More crying.  \n\"Alright man,\" I was agitated at this point, \"Have fun crying on a bench then.\"  \n\nThe kid was smart and did very well academically, but we're in our 30's now and after college it seems like he never really did anything with his life. According to facebook he's not in a relationship, works at a grocery store, and still lives in his hometown which makes me wonder if he ever even moved out of his parents' house.

Their mom was a collective 370 ish pounds, and had adopted all 5 of her kids, so she had this really narcissistic attitude about it. Weird, I know. \n\nThe rules were so weird that to this day they blow my mind. \n\n1. We weren\u2019t allowed to leave the rooms at late night or early morning, because it MIGHT wake her up. The few times she woke up, she\u2019d fly into a rage and scream at us kids (all under 10) for upwards to an hour and then make us (even me, the visitor) clean the house without giving us food or water. \n\n2. If we weren\u2019t punished, we had to stay outside ALL day, save maybe lunch and dinner. We weren\u2019t allowed inside for anything, and if we went in, we\u2019d be yelled at and told to clean.\n\n3. Pertaining to rule 2, we had a set quota of water we had to drink. Her kids were given pretty big jugs, so my siblings and I had to buy our own. The problem was, we couldn\u2019t go back inside for cold water after we drank the jug, so we were forced to drink hose water. And when we were allowed back in, we were asked how much we drank. Anything under 4 was met with yelling and a punishment of, you guessed it, cleaning. \n\n4. Her golden kid was allowed to do anything she wanted. She wasn\u2019t the oldest of the 5, but her word was law and her mom treated her like a goddess. We weren\u2019t allowed to contradict her. \n\nAn additional story: when I was 8, I was really into LEGO Star Wars. This led to my friends getting it too, and we would play it together at their house. One day, we were told no video games, and I wasn\u2019t entirely sure about the rule so I asked if she said no video games in the morning, or if she meant all day. \n\nThey just kinda went all scared and didn\u2019t say much, but then I go out to eat, and their mom was like \u201cyou told them you wanted to play video games all day? After I said no? You realize I have to tell your mom now.\u201d And little me was so scared that I was in huge trouble. \n\nDuring this time my mom was.. emotionally compromised. Severe depression, anxiety, the whole nine yards. Nowadays she\u2019s my number 1 supporter, and she heavily apologized for this later, but when I got home, I got spanked and grounded.\n Later, (as in, a couple years later) she told me that she was told that I threatened the two boys about the video games and said I wouldn\u2019t be their friends if they didn\u2019t let me play. And the mom made this a huge deal. Posted it on social media, posted an 8 year old kid as an abusive and violent person, so much so our church got involved. It was a massive mess, and I\u2019m glad that part of my life is past.

I put out bowls of ice water for her and some watermelon, but I didn't see her take them. \n\nI do tell my kid that they save up change they find on the ground and buy her presents sometimes, so she has bonded with them and will sit outside and yell at them about her day, ask what they're up to, tell them what kind of candy she likes....", "score": 1, "likes": null, "upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "replies": [{"author": "kayteashores", "id": "e53iof3", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9bg5nn/real_estate_agents_of_reddit_whats_a_subtle_red/e53iof3/", "content": "If your daughter doesn\u2019t become a Disney princess who can control them with song I will be disappointed and you will have missed a great opportunity ", "score": 1, "likes": null, "upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"author": "SeattleBattles", "id": "e53hcby", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9bg5nn/real_estate_agents_of_reddit_whats_a_subtle_red/e53hcby/", "content": "I've felt the same way when I've gone to places like India where parks are filled with monkeys.

There's nothing worse than the sneaky buyer who uses his survey report as a tool to lowball the seller after agreeing a sensible price. \n\nThat said: Look out for movement around the bays of older houses, the foundations are not dug as deep around bay windows.\n\nRoofs last around 80 years, know where in it's lifespan your roof is. \n\nYou can cover most things with indemnity insurance.  \n\nWoodworm, mould, infestations and damp are all caused by an imbalance of humidity.

Those are the most expensive items to replace/repair with owning a home. Check for new paint that doesn't match existing paint, and look under rugs/and behind pictures. You'd be surprised to know how many sellers like to \"oops didn't know that was there, when they've got a massive rug covering a massive hole in the hardwood floors/or large picture hiding a large whole or crack in the wall, that was just there when they purchased the home.\" Always, and I mean always, hire an inspector!! You're going to need it, if it comes back that the seller lied on the Seller's Disclosure, you have evidence. On a new build, I still suggest an inspector, but the benefit of having a 10-15 year warranty helps, so it's less of an issue, unless you're paying contractor directly, then you bet you rass you're going to need an inspector!.

Cave diving got its start back in the late 60s/early 70s.  It developed a reputation for being extremely dangerous, mainly due to the lack of training and general unreliability of equipment.  Lots of people died and valuable lessons were learned from the causal factors.  Today, equipment is extremely reliable if properly maintained.  The likelihood of experiencing a major failure is slim.  Training has also developed exponentially to the point where a well trained cave diver with high quality, well maintained equipment takes on more risk driving to the dive site than actually cave diving.  As a result of this, along with technological innovation, exploration is blowing up.  Highly experienced teams are laying miles of survey line at depths exceeding 300'.  I've seen pictures and video of previously unexplored cave passages that have seen fewer people than the surface of the moon.  There are connections waiting to be made and entirely new systems waiting to be discovered.  We may have largely explored the surface of the earth, but we know very little about what's underneath the surface (as well as under the oceans).

Why? Because the top UK cave divers are considered to be the best in the field; the conditions in the UK are challenging when compared to the caves often dived in locations such as Florida, where many go to get experience with more accommodating caves. In the UK, it is considered ill-advised to become a cave diver without some potholing (caving) experience beforehand, as most of the dive sites are well into caves that require skills learned from such training.\n\nThis was a necessary skillset to have as the actual in-water part of the Thai operation was only a fraction of the job. While the water in the cave was no more than 5m deep, the swim was a long and arduous affair, and between the outside world and the chamber the children were in, there were 2 dry chambers without water in.\n\nYou correctly identified the use of sidemount cylinders, however we don't use oxygen cylinders alone in diving due to 100% O2 becoming toxic at 6m, as well as the potential effects of O2 toxcitity due to what is in simple terms over exposure to the gas (results in seizures, which can be survived as long as someone holds your reg in your mouth long enough for seizures to subside). \n\nThey were using rebreathers which operate on not only a 100% oxygen cylinder, but also a diluent (\"dil\") cylinder used to reduced that O2 percentage to acceptable levels for the dive to be carried out. As an example, while 21% (regular air) can be used to 56m theoretically, to reach greater depths we would use a gas mix lower than this, diluting it with helium to create \"trimix\" (O2, N, He). The greatest depth a human has dived to is 750m, and would have required a far lower % oxygen (approx. 2%).\n\nThe individual who died is said to have \"run out of oxygen\" which implies that he did not die in the water, but rather after removing his regulator and breathing in a dry chamber with a hypoxic gas (lower than the % O2 required by a human at 1 earth atmosphere of pressure). I haven't found any details regarding this but the terminology suggests if the writer knew what they were saying, this is likely the case.\n\nThe divers involved in planning predicted a 20% fatality rate, and it is a testament to their skill in planning and execution that all the trapped individuals made it out.\n\nScrew Elon Musk for what he said. I can't believe he called a hero a \"pedo\" because nobody wanted him killing kids with his half baked ideas.\n\nHope this gave some extra detail, any questions just ask and I will answer to the best of my ability, though I am not myself a diver that was on site and am willing to say when I just don't know the answers.", "score": 26, "likes": null, "upvote": 26, "downvote": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"author": "helodriver87", "id": "e529e12", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9b9flk/what_is_it_that_we_are_living_in_the_golden_age_of/e529e12/", "content": "Yep, inability to surface is a big one.

You have a running gag so you have to build up to it, you warn the audience that it is coming, you have the camera zoom in on the guy just before he says it, and you follow up with a musical flourish plus canned laughter. Essentially you have to milk it for every last drop of humor in it, because you've overused it already. \n\nA call-back is more subtle by an order of magnitude. It's not over-used again and again but may be something that happens a handful of times or less in an entire run. You don't call attention to it, or build it up, or warn the audience that it is coming. Instead, it is more likely to be a throwaway line in a longer monologue, or a prop seen in the background. It's a single word in a verse rather than an entire chorus. And because you haven't over-used it, you can afford to let it sit there and only be picked up by a small portion of the audience. \n\nSomething else to throw in here is that a call-back is something that becomes more valuable narratively in the age of DVR, Netflix, and Internet fan forums where people share these kinds of details. In that sort of environment, you can afford to put some effort into a \"hidden\" or minor detail and know that it won't get wasted because someone will eventually pick up on it and point it out, which furthers the appreciation of your work. In the past, you didn't have that kind of opportunity so if you worked on a joke you wanted to put it front and center because it only had one chance to be seen.

The best by far. I wish there was a way to auto play it so I didn\u2019t have to go through a menu for each episode. The re-edit just makes me sad. It\u2019s had all the things that were unique to it sucked out. It was actually a really interesting complex story instead of just a bunch of silly, although very funny, hijinks.  Everyone selfishly doing their own thing and yet still tied up with each other in ways continuously revealed and expanded upon and explored throughout the season.\n\nLike with Lindsey and Tobias and Meabe all on the same flight and Micheal and George Sr making plans with each other and bargaining. And the whole thing with George-Micheal fake block being a fake block with Meabe building an entire business around it only to inexplicably watch it crumble. Each one of these things realigns what you think was happening and changes your perspective on the whole thing.  Which is a really cool thing for a storyteller to pull off. But the re-edit just puts it all out in the beginning. Ruining the buildup and the surprise and the misdirections. \n\nAlso parts where the characters would interact but you\u2019d only see the part of the conversation that mattered to the person whose episode it was, it really highlights how self centered they each are. So focused on their own stuff and completely oblivious to each other. The selfishness makes for good comedy in the shows original airing. And the way each episode of season four was laser focused on one individual made for some really interesting storytelling. It is the unreliable narrator story telling device, taken to its most extreme and from multiple different angles. It was really interesting to see it play out.\n\nI liked when it would be something like \u201cso and so realized he hadn\u2019t been listening for several minutes now\u201d, but then later we see that moment from the other characters perspective and it was some really important stuff, from a different point of view. They weren\u2019t around for each other even when they were in the same room,  the camera would pan out to a larger shot from one character\u2019s episode, the scene would literally expand, and we\u2019d realize that a character had been there, but now we see things differently. Stuff like that just doesn\u2019t work in the re-edit, trying to force a multilayered complex story into a the format of the show as it has been when it was a standard sitcom. \n\nIt\u2019s really an excellent season. But there can be no doubt that it wasn\u2019t what anybody expected. But to me that makes it even better, and so much more sad that it had to be altered.

To get *more* than that, they would need to spend cash, but the better food was very expensive (due to wartime shortages and a lot being shipped to the German army) and work was rare and underpaid. The German occupiers did not pay a lot of cash out to the French and often resorted to pressed service for their projects like the Atlantic wall.\n\nTLDR: The French had more than 2500 Calories per week, but to get above starvation level they had to buy expensive food with money they didn't have.\n\nEdit: Okay, 1100 calories a day is not borderline starvation. But given all other factors, it wasn't good. Hard labor, lots of walking, poor nutritional value, and poor heating due to conserving coal and power, makes 1100 calories bad for a petson.

The only reason why you played it at all was because you were dead broke and it was the only thing you could get your hands on.

The quality of low end guitars below $500 is actually good, which is saying a lot.  \n\nYou can actually buy a starter guitar between $100 - $200 that doesn't sound like shit.  It won't be great but it will be just good enough to give you a taste of what that instrument is capable of doing.  And from there if you later upgrade to a $500 - $1000 the quality there is consistently good enough to be professional.  \n\nThere are excellent instruments out there at affordable prices that are less than a brand new computer.

There are some streaming options, but most are targeted at a superfan who wants to watch out-of-market games, not at a cord cutter who just wants to watch the local team. It seems like many of them have restrictions such as IP-based blackouts to prevent you from watching your local team - the implication is that you should have cable TV subscription for local games, and stream out-of-market games.\n\nTo your latter point, IMO it's a bit of a dilemma - ten years ago you had a $150 cable package with 500 channels, and we all said \"why am I paying for all these channels I don't care about?\". So we got a la carte pricing, but now it's \"ugh, I need six different $15/mo subscriptions to watch all of the shows I like\". I'm not sure what the right answer is - maybe a la carte individual show pricing? Netflix has a bunch of originals and it's $15/mo or whatever if I want to watch just one of them, or all of them. But would I pay $0.99 an episode to just watch *The Crown*? I don't know. Having to pay for individual services definitely makes it feel like you're spending more money. I can forget about my $30/month phone bill once I've paid it, but I would feel like I am getting nickle and dimed if I had to authorize a $1 transaction every morning before my phone could turn on.

I'll say again what I signed up to say the first time:\n\n*Astronomy and cosmology*.\n\nIt's hard to believe, but it's only been 20 years since we discovered that the universe's expansion is accelerating! Before then it was a possibility that the expansion could reverse and the universe would end in a Big Crunch.\n\nThe first exoplanets were only discovered in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Even thirty years ago it was easy to think that planets, and Earth-like planets in particular, were incredibly rare occurrences in the universe. But now we've discovered thousands of exoplanets! It started with huge (Jupiter-plus) exoplanets closely orbiting small stars, but as our technology has improved we've been able to detect smaller planets orbiting further from their stars, and can even infer what some of their atmospheres contain. We've already found super-Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting in the habitable zone of their parent stars! I am eagerly awaiting the day the JWST telescope goes into operation, because I'm betting the discovery of Earth-sized exoplanets, with oxygen in their atmosphere and orbiting in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star, won't be far behind.\n\nAlso, as our imaging of the Cosmic Microwave Background gets more precise, we've been able to refine the accuracy of our measurement of the age and matter distribution of the universe. Our most recent full-sky measurement of the CMB is from the Planck probe in 2013, and new telescopes and research projects are set to improve upon it.\n\nAnd we detected gravitational waves just two years ago!\n\nAnd we're close to being able to directly image a black hole!\n\nAnd there's probably another few dozen groundbreaking discoveries that I can't even remember right now!\n\n...\n\nAll in all, the past 20-some years have been an absolute golden age of cosmological discoveries. And with improved techniques and theories, and the exponential increase of computing power to back them up, the next 20 years are looking to be just as golden.", "score": 160, "likes": null, "upvote": 160, "downvote": 0, "replies": []}, {"author": "DarthFikus", "id": "e51aghe", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9b9flk/what_is_it_that_we_are_living_in_the_golden_age_of/e51aghe/", "content": "Memes", "score": 3692, "likes": null, "upvote": 3692, "downvote": 0, "replies": [{"author": "J_Slop", "id": "e51ma3h", "url": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9b9flk/what_is_it_that_we_are_living_in_the_golden_age_of/e51ma3h/", "content": "Na we're passed the golden age of memes.

Some of the most incredible pieces of art are now functional pieces and sell for upwards of 100,000 dollars.

Have your porch light on (if applicable).\n\n2. If your subdivision/building has a code, tell the person that takes your order (or type it in if online). If you don\u2019t do that then the driver will have to call you to get it.\n\n3. If you know you\u2019re going to be placing a large order (as in 5ish pizzas), then please call/order in plenty of time. Party orders (10+) absolutely should be called in ahead of time.\n\n4. If you\u2019re disappointed by the wait time, ask if there were any issues finding your place. But please do so in a proper tone rather than accusatory (aka don\u2019t be an asshole). Sometimes I would leave the store with the map saying it\u2019s 5 minutes away, only for a road to be closed or the actual road looking like someone\u2019s driveway. If there was an issue finding the place, then you can assist in making sure it\u2019s easier the next time when it\u2019s likely a different driver.\n\n5. Use a little common sense and realize that certain times (like Friday and Saturday from 5-10) are super busy. If you aren\u2019t sure what you want, don\u2019t call right away. Look online at the offerings first (and just order online anyway) so that you aren\u2019t taking up a lot of time thinking of what you want while all 6 lines are ringing, there\u2019s 4 customers at the front, and pizzas are about to fall out of the oven.\n\n6. Order online. Since I just mentioned it, ordering online is super simple and ensures you are getting exactly what you want because you can literally read your own order. Customer complaints from phone orders was about 3% when I worked there. Customer complaints from online orders was less than 1%.\n\nEdit: 7. If your apartment complex has weird numbering, then add more description (such as which entrance to use if multiple, any landmark nearby, etc). Some complexes are super simple where unit 1234 is the 1st building, 2nd stairwell, 3rd floor, 4th unit. Others are convoluted like where they start with unit 1 and then just start counting up, but some buildings have 6 units and some have 8 and sometimes the numbering jumps across the street rather than moving to the next building. Also a lot of complexes do a shitty job of marking buildings.\n\n8. If you have a mailbox and your HOA allows, get some big address numbers and put them on your mailbox.

Do not get your kid a pet of any kind unless you are willing to be that animal\u2019s sole caretaker for the rest of its life, in the all too common eventuality that your child completely loses interest in it before long.\n\n7. Pets make horrible gifts. \u201cSurprise! I know you like turtles, so I\u2019m springing 40 years worth of commitment and extra expenses on you for your birthday! You\u2019re welcome!!\u201d\n\n8. Do not buy terrestrial hermit crabs. They are fascinating animals, but horrible pets. They have complex and specific needs in captivity that are way beyond the scope of what the average person is willing to invest in a pet that hates human contact. People take such abysmal care of them that they say their crabs \u201clasted a while\u201d when they die after 8 months; in reality these animals should easily live well beyond 25 years. The same is basically true for red eared slider turtles and goldfish as well, really.

It was also customary for them to wash the bike after every service.  Their mechanics could have said \"you don't need it but we will put new ones on if you're worried\" and I would have said yes.  A free upsell, all they had to do was not f\\*\\*k up.\n\n* Going in, the bike was clean'ish but not super clean - water marks from rain, that's about it.  Coming out, the bike was dirty, like it'd been wiped down with a dirty, oily rag. Being a dual sport, I didn't care about the wash, but this meant I took a closer look at the rest of the bike.\n* The oil change was done, but it wasn't done right.  Oil wasn't filled up on level ground, so it was overfull.\n* I asked about the tires.  They said they were fine.  TL,DR: I had to get them replaced while on the road in California, with overnight shipping on the tires, because I was getting speed wobbles at 60 mph due to massive wear.\n* I asked about the brake pads.  They said they were 50% worn.  This is the same shop that, 6 months and 10,000 mi prior, had said they were 70% worn.  I called him out on that.  They doubled down on that assessment.  I swapped the pads myself when I returned and they were almost down to the metal.\n\nI did my trip, came back, fixed all the problems they had screwed up on the bike, and then posted my review online, sent it to my friends, and also shared it with the extended motorcycling community in a very detailed, very specific list of grievances.\n\nThe owner called me back, asked me to remove my review, and said how sorry he was and to give them another chance. I am normally a very forgiving person, but at this point I doubled down on my statements:  I pointed out that these were not minor issues, that they were life threatening when they happened, and that it was a very, VERY easy problem for them to solve that would have earned them at least another $400.

Was a very junior analyst in a big consulting firm. All senior consultants were arrogant, self righteous, know-it-all, privileged ivy league graduates (anyone who worked in some of the top 10 consulting firms would know what I mean).\n\nI was doing well, learning my trade with success. In one of the performance reviews with my boss, I mentioned that it would be good if I had opportunities of doing presentations to clients, to help boost my public speaking and cure my social anxiety. No big deal, since as a junior analyst, one of my task was to summarize the researches I was tasked with into power point presentations that the senior consultants would put final tweaks on and then present.\n\nMy boss mentioned it to the senior consultant I worked with on the biggest project. Kinda like *\"jetiro\\_now is young and need to work on his public speaking - he expressed his desire to do so. Give him some safe opportunity when you can.\"*\n\nFor some reason, the insecure prick didn't take it well. For our next client meeting, he tasked me to prepare the presentation (as usual), but then went ahead and changed everything (unusual): layout, moved content around, etc. He didn't share the final deck (unusual). We drove to the meeting and when it was time to present our recent data findings, he called on **me** to step forward to present them, in a room full of high tech execs (10+ PhDs and millionaires). I gasped, was shaking, didn't know how to decline. I stepped forward, faced them, turned around to the screen, realized that Slide #2 looked nothing like the Slide #2 I put together. As a consultant, you are not supposed to read what's on the screen (since the audience can read), but you are supposed to swiftly reference it and make comments. I faced the screen and read, word by word, every single word and number on every deck through the whole presentation. I was **deeply** embarrassed. At the end, when we drove back, he made comments in the line of \"you should stick to quantitative work\".\n\nI quit consulting the following month. I still cringe at that memory. I wouldn't wish to anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: guys, thanks for all the kind words. I am well past that and actually appreciate such experiences to get wiser. To answer a few points raised in the replies:\n\n\\- Why I didn't decline? Well, I was a 24yr old college graduate with public speaking anxiety and desire to impress. Even conjuring a refusal would have been impossible.\n\n\\- I think the audience could tell what just happened and read between the lines. One old lady (she was one of those unknown but super wealthy silicon valley investors) kept making eye contact with me during the presentation with a warming smile. She came to me afterwards and gave me a hug, told me I did well. I am sure she knew.\n\n\\- That wasn't actually my last straw in consulting, but it was the beginning to the end. I just couldn't  tolerate the toxic workaholic those guys live in. I mean, people proudly boasted they worked 20hrs a day. My boss took his laptop to the bathroom, and even made calls while being there. No time to rest, work-work-work. I was dating this girl (now my wife of 13yrs) and I barely had time to be with her. And yet I was still in an entry level position. So, my last straw was when I took my work laptop (that's what I had become myself) on a hiking trip with her one sunday afternoon and had my boss call me for almost an hour discussing an ongoing analysis I was doing. While picnic-ing with my girlfriend. I saw the look on her face and realized how deep I was going.

By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.\n\nC was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). \n\n**Now that the we're on the same page, what you need to understand is what variables are, so you can store your integers:**\n\nIn computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution.\n\nVariables in programming may not directly correspond to the concept of variables in mathematics. The latter is abstract, having no reference to a physical object such as storage location. The value of a computing variable is not necessarily part of an equation or formula as in mathematics. Variables in computer programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in transcription and manipulation. \n\n**Now on to your question:**\n\n    int a = 1;\n    int b = 1;\n    int c = a + b;", "score": 172, "likes": null, "upvote": 172, "downvote": 0, "replies": [{"author": "mahmudzero", "id": "e52ook6", "url": "/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/9bcwbb/since_these_cups_are_everywhere_now_i_figured_we/e52ook6/", "content": "Yes.

We\u2019re pleased to have you here, and to make your stay a little bit more enjoyable, we\u2019ve put together this brief overview of the subreddit, how it works, and what you can expect from the submissions here.\n\n-------\n\n**What Is A Showerthought?**    \n--\n\nIn simplest terms, **a showerthought is a miniature epiphany that makes the mundane more interesting**. It\u2019s an idea that offers people a new way of considering details that they might have otherwise overlooked. Showerthoughts can be funny, poignant, thought-provoking, or even just silly, but they should always prompt people to say \u201cHuh, I\u2019ve never thought about it that way before!\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cshowerthought\u201d comes from the fact that many of these musings occur to people while they\u2019re doing mindless, everyday activities (like showering, commuting, or just staring at the wall while waiting for a customer service representative to answer their telephone call). As such, **showerthoughts don\u2019t have to be had while showering**\u2026 and in fact, the presence of flowing water and shampoo is not enough to make a showerthought.\n\nHere are some examples of showerthoughts:\n\n- *\u201cYour stomach thinks all potatoes are mashed.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cWhen people think about traveling to the past, they worry about accidentally changing the present, but no one in the present really thinks they can radically change the future.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cAnything is a UFO if you\u2019re stupid enough.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cC-3PO is technically Luke Skywalker\u2019s older brother.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cSwans are loud, territorial, violent, aggressive, terrifying, and an emblem of romantic love.\u201d*\n\n------\n\n**What** ***Isn\u2019t*** **A Showerthought?**    \n--\n\nAs mentioned, showerthoughts should offer people new ways of looking at existing phenomena or objects. They *shouldn\u2019t* be personal opinions or perspectives, suggestions for new products or services, or questions that could be answered via a quick Google search. **Showerthoughts are almost exclusively conclusions, not premises**, and should be phrased in such a way as to be as close to universally applicable as possible. Furthermore, **all submissions to /r/Showerthoughts should be written well, and should be entirely unique**: If a similar-sounding thought can be found elsewhere on the Internet (not just in the subreddit), then it\u2019s probably better-suited for a different community. Finally, this subreddit is actively curated, meaning that low-effort, poorly written, nonsensical, unoriginal, and overly crude submissions will be removed at the moderators' discretion. \n\nHere are some examples of non-showerthoughts:\n\n- *\u201cDamn, I need to buy more soap.\u201d*      \n(This is a \u201cshower observation.\u201d)\n\n- *\u201cI hate it when cars cut me off, but I like seeing other people get cut off.\u201d*     \n(This is a personal perspective, since it\u2019s a commentary on the submitter\u2019s opinions or emotions.)\n\n- *\u201cTide should partner with Netflix to produce a really good show that turns out to be an advertisement.\u201d*     \n(This is something that would be more appropriately posted in /r/CrazyIdeas.)\n\n- *\u201cHas anyone ever tried tasting the top of Mount Everest?\u201d*     \n(This comes close to being a showerthought, but since it\u2019s phrased as a question, it would need to be rewritten before it would count as a \u201cminiature epiphany.\u201c)\n\n- *\u201cthe earth is prolly in a copmlety new place everyday\u201d*      \n(This would be removed for quality, given that it\u2019s poorly written and misuses the word \u201ceveryday\u201d instead of the phrase \u201cevery day.\u201d It\u2019s also a common thought.)\n\n- *\u201cWhat if bees have a literal hive mind?\u201d*      \n(This is a premise, not a conclusion, and would also be an instance of wordplay.)\n\n------\n\nAt times, coming up with a completely original, well-written, insightful thought can seem a little bit difficult\u2026 but that\u2019s what makes showerthoughts so appealing: They\u2019re the tiny realizations that you have when you aren\u2019t even aware that you\u2019ve been thinking, and they make the world that much more entertaining when they do crop up.\n\nHappy thinking!", "upvote": 4906, "downvote": 0, "upratio": 0.99, "subreddit": "r/Showerthoughts", "comments": {"comment": [{"author": "pippy64598", "id": "du7fnwr", "url": "/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7xde4g/what_is_a_showerthought/du7fnwr/", "content": "Not a showerthought, reported to mods.", "score": 2071, "likes": null, "upvote": 2071, "downvote": 0, "replies": [{"author": "Gehhhh", "id": "dumfshd", "url": "/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7xde4g/what_is_a_showerthought/dumfshd/", "content": "Pretty sure you would\u2019ve reported his post to himself.

You have to use it by picking out keywords and searching those. You might be able to get away with using Google pointed at reddit as well. \n\nTake this post for example.

I am aware of behind-the-scenes work going on in image-based subreddits to cut down on reposts. These bots use fuzzy matching algorithms as well.

There hasn't been a period of history with no technological advances, much less thousands of years, and the high middle ages( roughly 1000 - 1250) actually had a fair amount of technological advances to plows, ships, agricultural techniques -- which created a population boom -- and weaponry. But even beyond technology this period was actually pretty revolutionary in terms of social, political, and economic change. The first peasant armies came about, the church solidified it's dominance over earthly kings and social life, monasticism exploded amidst a Renaissance in the 1100s(the first colleges came about in this century or the previous), intense warfare and strife shook society from the bottom to the top -- not to mention the changes wrought by the Black Death near the end of the period -- the first era of European colonialism(the  crusades) began, gunpowder was introduced to Europe. This idea of a stagnant technological and social quagmire, unchanged until the nascent industrial revolution, is ahistorical and simply wrong. This is just Europe by the way. The near east and North Africa also experienced massive change. The Ottomans were using gunpowder and cannons to break the walls of Byzantium, along with a professional army. The Empire of Ghana was rapidly becoming the richest place on Earth in the Senegal River valley, inventing new interdependent means of trade throughout the region. I'm pretty sure China was going through some rapid expansion at the time, but that's not my area, really.

The other night I was watching a show about the Roman Colosseum. I really never thought much about it but it was quite the amazing structure when it was built. Under the huge removable arena floor are elevator shafts and lots and lots of corridors. The elevator shafts were used to hoist up cages of wild animals onto the arena floor. The shafts opened up in various places onto the floor and to the spectators it looked like magic. Lion would suddenly appear. \n\nThe more amazing feature of the Colosseum was that the arena could be flooded with millions of gallons of water which would be about five or six feet deep. There would be several ships there and prisoners were used to recreate battles to the death. Many would drown because they didn't know how to swim. I guess they didn't figure out all the had to do was stand up. \n\nThe arena floor was held up by huge wooden beams that were put in place in their prospective square holes and could be removed. It's crazy to think that people back then had such great minds to come up with this stuff. Oh and also, gladiator fights weren't what some people believe they were. There was always a referee to make sure the fight was a fair one. When a gladiator got tired out and could no longer fight his opponent he would hold up one finger to stop the fight. The crowd had to decide if he had fought a good fight or not. If he *did* then the crowd would let him live to fight another day. If the crowd determined the guy was weak or just didn't fight well enough they would make a gesture with their thumb. They would point their thumb toward their throat. This told the winner to stab the loser in the throat. Also, gladiators were paid a handsome salary and it sucked to lose one but that's the way it was. Gladiators weren't forced to fight each other.

When you get there, you retrieve a dude, bring him to 2015, and then walk him around and watch him react to everything. It\u2019s impossible for us to understand what it would be like for him to see shiny capsules racing by on a highway, talk to people who had been on the other side of the ocean earlier in the day, watch sports that were being played 1,000 miles away, hear a musical performance that happened 50 years ago, and play with my magical wizard rectangle that he could use to capture a real-life image or record a living moment, generate a map with a paranormal moving blue dot that shows him where he is, look at someone\u2019s face and chat with them even though they\u2019re on the other side of the country, and worlds of other inconceivable sorcery. This is all before you show him the internet or explain things like the International Space Station, the Large Hadron Collider, nuclear weapons, or general relativity.\nThis experience for him wouldn\u2019t be surprising or shocking or even mind-blowing\u2014those words aren\u2019t big enough. He might actually die.\nBut here\u2019s the interesting thing\u2014if he then went back to 1750 and got jealous that we got to see his reaction and decided he wanted to try the same thing, he\u2019d take the time machine and go back the same distance, get someone from around the year 1500, bring him to 1750, and show him everything. And the 1500 guy would be shocked by a lot of things\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t die. It would be\u00a0far\u00a0less of an insane experience for him, because while 1500 and 1750 were very different, they were\u00a0much\u00a0less\u00a0different than 1750 to 2015. The 1500 guy would learn some mind-bending shit about space and physics, he\u2019d be impressed with how committed Europe turned out to be with that new imperialism fad, and he\u2019d have to do some major revisions of his world map conception. But watching everyday life go by in 1750\u2014transportation, communication, etc.\u2014definitely wouldn\u2019t make him die.\nNo, in order for the 1750 guy to have as much fun as we had with him, he\u2019d have to go much farther back\u2014maybe all the way back to about 12,000 BC, before the First Agricultural Revolution gave rise to the first cities and to the concept of civilization. If someone from a purely hunter-gatherer world\u2014from a time when humans were, more or less, just another animal species\u2014saw the vast human empires of 1750 with their towering churches, their ocean-crossing ships, their concept of being \u201cinside,\u201d and their enormous mountain of collective, accumulated human knowledge and discovery\u2014he\u2019d likely die.\nAnd then what if, after dying,\u00a0he\u00a0got jealous and wanted to do the same thing. If he went back 12,000 years to 24,000 BC and got a guy and brought him to 12,000 BC, he\u2019d show the guy everything and the guy would be like, \u201cOkay what\u2019s your point who cares.\u201d For the 12,000 BC guy to have the same fun, he\u2019d have to go back over 100,000 years and get someone he could show fire and language to for the first time.\n\nIn order for someone to be transported into the future and die from the level of shock they\u2019d experience, they have to go enough years ahead that a \u201cdie level of progress,\u201d or a Die Progress Unit (DPU) has been achieved. So a DPU took over 100,000 years in hunter-gatherer times, but at the post-Agricultural Revolution rate, it only took about 12,000 years. The post-Industrial Revolution world has moved so quickly that a 1750 person only needs to go forward a couple hundred years for a DPU to have happened.\n\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html", "score": 2, "likes": null, "upvote": 2, "downvote": 0, "replies": []}, {"author": "BenedickCabbagepatch", "id": "e539386", "url": "/r/Showerthoughts/comments/9bhkeg/you_ever_think_about_what_people_will_be_like_in/e539386/", "content": "For the sake of their mental health, I'm glad my pathetic arse was incomprehensibly hard to predict for them.", "score": 2, "likes": null, "upvote": 2, "downvote": 0, "replies": []}, {"author": "Fig1024", "id": "e539cr9", "url": "/r/Showerthoughts/comments/9bhkeg/you_ever_think_about_what_people_will_be_like_in/e539cr9/", "content": "if technological pace is not interrupted, 1000s years from now we would have true AI that would evolve beyond human control.

That's the weird thing. Or rather, it _is_ (obviously) but the _tremendous gravity_ at the core of the sun is doing most of the actual work. The temperature at the million is only about 10M degrees, and you need about 100M to produce fusion under standard vacuum conditions, but the sheer compressive force delivered by the sun's vast gravity is enough to \"cheat\" the fusion into happening at a far lower temperature than it would need to happen at on Earth. That's why fusion reactors are so hard to start - we can't generate the vast pressures the sun does, so we need to do ALL the fusion through temperature which is insanely difficult and power-consuming.
