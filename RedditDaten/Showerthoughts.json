We\u2019re pleased to have you here, and to make your stay a little bit more enjoyable, we\u2019ve put together this brief overview of the subreddit, how it works, and what you can expect from the submissions here.\n\n-------\n\n**What Is A Showerthought?**    \n--\n\nIn simplest terms, **a showerthought is a miniature epiphany that makes the mundane more interesting**. It\u2019s an idea that offers people a new way of considering details that they might have otherwise overlooked. Showerthoughts can be funny, poignant, thought-provoking, or even just silly, but they should always prompt people to say \u201cHuh, I\u2019ve never thought about it that way before!\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cshowerthought\u201d comes from the fact that many of these musings occur to people while they\u2019re doing mindless, everyday activities (like showering, commuting, or just staring at the wall while waiting for a customer service representative to answer their telephone call). As such, **showerthoughts don\u2019t have to be had while showering**\u2026 and in fact, the presence of flowing water and shampoo is not enough to make a showerthought.\n\nHere are some examples of showerthoughts:\n\n- *\u201cYour stomach thinks all potatoes are mashed.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cWhen people think about traveling to the past, they worry about accidentally changing the present, but no one in the present really thinks they can radically change the future.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cAnything is a UFO if you\u2019re stupid enough.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cC-3PO is technically Luke Skywalker\u2019s older brother.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cSwans are loud, territorial, violent, aggressive, terrifying, and an emblem of romantic love.\u201d*\n\n------\n\n**What** ***Isn\u2019t*** **A Showerthought?**    \n--\n\nAs mentioned, showerthoughts should offer people new ways of looking at existing phenomena or objects. They *shouldn\u2019t* be personal opinions or perspectives, suggestions for new products or services, or questions that could be answered via a quick Google search. **Showerthoughts are almost exclusively conclusions, not premises**, and should be phrased in such a way as to be as close to universally applicable as possible. Furthermore, **all submissions to /r/Showerthoughts should be written well, and should be entirely unique**: If a similar-sounding thought can be found elsewhere on the Internet (not just in the subreddit), then it\u2019s probably better-suited for a different community. Finally, this subreddit is actively curated, meaning that low-effort, poorly written, nonsensical, unoriginal, and overly crude submissions will be removed at the moderators' discretion. \n\nHere are some examples of non-showerthoughts:\n\n- *\u201cDamn, I need to buy more soap.\u201d*      \n(This is a \u201cshower observation.\u201d)\n\n- *\u201cI hate it when cars cut me off, but I like seeing other people get cut off.\u201d*     \n(This is a personal perspective, since it\u2019s a commentary on the submitter\u2019s opinions or emotions.)\n\n- *\u201cTide should partner with Netflix to produce a really good show that turns out to be an advertisement.\u201d*     \n(This is something that would be more appropriately posted in /r/CrazyIdeas.)\n\n- *\u201cHas anyone ever tried tasting the top of Mount Everest?\u201d*     \n(This comes close to being a showerthought, but since it\u2019s phrased as a question, it would need to be rewritten before it would count as a \u201cminiature epiphany.\u201c)\n\n- *\u201cthe earth is prolly in a copmlety new place everyday\u201d*      \n(This would be removed for quality, given that it\u2019s poorly written and misuses the word \u201ceveryday\u201d instead of the phrase \u201cevery day.\u201d It\u2019s also a common thought.)\n\n- *\u201cWhat if bees have a literal hive mind?\u201d*      \n(This is a premise, not a conclusion, and would also be an instance of wordplay.)\n\n------\n\nAt times, coming up with a completely original, well-written, insightful thought can seem a little bit difficult\u2026 but that\u2019s what makes showerthoughts so appealing: They\u2019re the tiny realizations that you have when you aren\u2019t even aware that you\u2019ve been thinking, and they make the world that much more entertaining when they do crop up.\n\nHappy thinking!", "upvote": 4915, "downvote": 0, "upratio": 0.99, "subreddit": "r/Showerthoughts", "comments": [{"author": "pippy64598", "id": "du7fnwr", "url": "/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7xde4g/what_is_a_showerthought/du7fnwr/", "content": "Not a showerthought, reported to mods.", "score": 2075, "likes": 0, "upvote": 2075, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "Gehhhh", "id": "dumfshd", "url": "/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7xde4g/what_is_a_showerthought/dumfshd/", "content": "Pretty sure you would\u2019ve reported his post to himself.

Reddit's search functionality is useless for finding similar content if there is content that matches exactly. So you can't just throw a post in and find very similar results. You have to use it by picking out keywords and searching those. You might be able to get away with using Google pointed at reddit as well. \n\nTake this post for example. [Jenga is the opposite of Tetris](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7xjmgh/jenga_is_the_opposite_of_tetris/). Obvious repost. Let's search for it. [Four results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/search?q=Jenga+is+the+opposite+of+Tetris.&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). Okay. Let's break it into the key parts of the thought. \"Jenga opposite Tetris\" [six results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/search?q=Jenga+opposite+Tetris.&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). So we can easily miss posts by simple searching. [Google returns a bunch of extraneous stuff](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+Jenga+is+the+opposite+of+Tetris.).\n\nHowever, if we could implement our own fuzzy matching algorithm, we could do some really cool stuff with that. I am aware of behind-the-scenes work going on in image-based subreddits to cut down on reposts. These bots use fuzzy matching algorithms as well. However, in order to do that, we need all of the data. \n\nSo, we (the mods of reddit) are trying.

A font was a collection of physical objects: pieces of wood or metal that would be inked and then applied to the surface being printed. A complete font would contain multiple copies of commonly-used characters, so that you could typeset an entire line of text at a time.\n\nIn modern digital typography, a font is a computer file (`.otf` or the like) containing a machine-understandable description of each glyph, including its mathematical shape (B\u00e9zier curves and straight lines). Through mathematical manipulation of that shape, one font can be rendered at any size, any weight (light/thin, bold), any letter spacing (condensed, expanded), and in several styles (oblique, small caps). Those variants may be provided as separate fonts, but modern text renderers will automatically generate them on-the-fly if separate fonts aren't available.\n\nIn other words, in digital typography, the distinction between \u201cfont\u201d and \u201ctypeface\u201d is somewhat blurry. Instead, a collection of digital fonts with the same name, each representing a variation on the same general theme, is usually called a \u201cfont family\u201d.

If atoms were like you suggest, they would be able to rotate; the fact that atoms do not rotate has direct experimental consequences related to the heat capacity of atomic gases.\n\nYou can indeed make non-spherical atoms, but you'd need to prepare them in an external magnetic field or something like that. Such a space-fixed field will give you a *z*\\-direction at least.\n\n\"Atoms\" as commonly understood exist in *mixed states*. Mixed states (not the same as superpositions) cannot be represented by wave functions, but instead their expectation values must be computed from *density matrices.*\n\nDue to their unbiased preparation history, the mixing coefficients of atomic density matrices must all be identical. Therefore, to get the electron density of a mixed state, you can simply take the average of the densities of the component states, so eg. for P-states you get the average of the densities of Px, Py and Pz. If you modulus-square the spherical harmonics and add them together, you always get something with spherical symmetry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nIf you don't apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, all molecules are spherical too! And guess what... not just molecules, but bigger things also.\n\nIt doesn't stop, it's quantum mechanics all the way up, just look at that Hamiltonian, it's rotationally invariant!\n\nEverything in the whole universe is actually spherical in some sense.
