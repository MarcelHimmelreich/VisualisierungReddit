We\u2019re pleased to have you here, and to make your stay a little bit more enjoyable, we\u2019ve put together this brief overview of the subreddit, how it works, and what you can expect from the submissions here.\n\n-------\n\n**What Is A Showerthought?**    \n--\n\nIn simplest terms, **a showerthought is a miniature epiphany that makes the mundane more interesting**. It\u2019s an idea that offers people a new way of considering details that they might have otherwise overlooked. Showerthoughts can be funny, poignant, thought-provoking, or even just silly, but they should always prompt people to say \u201cHuh, I\u2019ve never thought about it that way before!\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cshowerthought\u201d comes from the fact that many of these musings occur to people while they\u2019re doing mindless, everyday activities (like showering, commuting, or just staring at the wall while waiting for a customer service representative to answer their telephone call). As such, **showerthoughts don\u2019t have to be had while showering**\u2026 and in fact, the presence of flowing water and shampoo is not enough to make a showerthought.\n\nHere are some examples of showerthoughts:\n\n- *\u201cYour stomach thinks all potatoes are mashed.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cWhen people think about traveling to the past, they worry about accidentally changing the present, but no one in the present really thinks they can radically change the future.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cAnything is a UFO if you\u2019re stupid enough.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cC-3PO is technically Luke Skywalker\u2019s older brother.\u201d*\n\n- *\u201cSwans are loud, territorial, violent, aggressive, terrifying, and an emblem of romantic love.\u201d*\n\n------\n\n**What** ***Isn\u2019t*** **A Showerthought?**    \n--\n\nAs mentioned, showerthoughts should offer people new ways of looking at existing phenomena or objects. They *shouldn\u2019t* be personal opinions or perspectives, suggestions for new products or services, or questions that could be answered via a quick Google search. **Showerthoughts are almost exclusively conclusions, not premises**, and should be phrased in such a way as to be as close to universally applicable as possible. Furthermore, **all submissions to /r/Showerthoughts should be written well, and should be entirely unique**: If a similar-sounding thought can be found elsewhere on the Internet (not just in the subreddit), then it\u2019s probably better-suited for a different community. Finally, this subreddit is actively curated, meaning that low-effort, poorly written, nonsensical, unoriginal, and overly crude submissions will be removed at the moderators' discretion. \n\nHere are some examples of non-showerthoughts:\n\n- *\u201cDamn, I need to buy more soap.\u201d*      \n(This is a \u201cshower observation.\u201d)\n\n- *\u201cI hate it when cars cut me off, but I like seeing other people get cut off.\u201d*     \n(This is a personal perspective, since it\u2019s a commentary on the submitter\u2019s opinions or emotions.)\n\n- *\u201cTide should partner with Netflix to produce a really good show that turns out to be an advertisement.\u201d*     \n(This is something that would be more appropriately posted in /r/CrazyIdeas.)\n\n- *\u201cHas anyone ever tried tasting the top of Mount Everest?\u201d*     \n(This comes close to being a showerthought, but since it\u2019s phrased as a question, it would need to be rewritten before it would count as a \u201cminiature epiphany.\u201c)\n\n- *\u201cthe earth is prolly in a copmlety new place everyday\u201d*      \n(This would be removed for quality, given that it\u2019s poorly written and misuses the word \u201ceveryday\u201d instead of the phrase \u201cevery day.\u201d It\u2019s also a common thought.)\n\n- *\u201cWhat if bees have a literal hive mind?\u201d*      \n(This is a premise, not a conclusion, and would also be an instance of wordplay.)\n\n------\n\nAt times, coming up with a completely original, well-written, insightful thought can seem a little bit difficult\u2026 but that\u2019s what makes showerthoughts so appealing: They\u2019re the tiny realizations that you have when you aren\u2019t even aware that you\u2019ve been thinking, and they make the world that much more entertaining when they do crop up.\n\nHappy thinking!", "upvote": 4908, "downvote": 0, "upratio": 0.99, "subreddit": "r/Showerthoughts", "comments": [{"author": "pippy64598", "id": "du7fnwr", "url": "/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7xde4g/what_is_a_showerthought/du7fnwr/", "content": "Not a showerthought, reported to mods.", "score": 2069, "likes": 0, "upvote": 2069, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "Gehhhh", "id": "dumfshd", "url": "/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7xde4g/what_is_a_showerthought/dumfshd/", "content": "Pretty sure you would\u2019ve reported his post to himself.

Reddit's search functionality is useless for finding similar content if there is content that matches exactly. So you can't just throw a post in and find very similar results. You have to use it by picking out keywords and searching those. You might be able to get away with using Google pointed at reddit as well. \n\nTake this post for example. [Jenga is the opposite of Tetris](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7xjmgh/jenga_is_the_opposite_of_tetris/). Obvious repost. Let's search for it. [Four results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/search?q=Jenga+is+the+opposite+of+Tetris.&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). Okay. Let's break it into the key parts of the thought. \"Jenga opposite Tetris\" [six results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/search?q=Jenga+opposite+Tetris.&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). So we can easily miss posts by simple searching. [Google returns a bunch of extraneous stuff](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+Jenga+is+the+opposite+of+Tetris.).\n\nHowever, if we could implement our own fuzzy matching algorithm, we could do some really cool stuff with that. I am aware of behind-the-scenes work going on in image-based subreddits to cut down on reposts. These bots use fuzzy matching algorithms as well. However, in order to do that, we need all of the data. \n\nSo, we (the mods of reddit) are trying.

I mean, why there is not someone to take thise carts and park them? Do u think that the company behind the big mall is poor? So, from my perspective, they should be giving extra service to customers and kill two flies with it..as it creates jobs for specific group of people, who would love to \"help\".\n\nIn my country, we even create \"fake jobs\" for those people, we pay so they can sit somewhere, do soemthing and feel better. Well, doesnt matter...im just saying, as long. as there are jobless people, it is stupid, to pressure customers to do something like this...\n\nThe OP was saying, that regular staff doesnr have time to park those carts..and i am saying. create more jobs, and save time of others while creating some jobs :)", "score": 1, "likes": 0, "upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "SomeStupidPerson", "id": "e5cie9n", "url": "/r/Showerthoughts/comments/9cmm9x/its_sad_that_something_as_simple_as_putting_a/e5cie9n/", "content": "You\u2019re assuming that they\u2019re going to hire disabled people as some form of charity to them because they need to/can hire people to do extra work because customers can be lazy sometimes.\n\nThey aren\u2019t going to do that. \n\nThey\u2019re going to hire people who can do the job in an efficient and least costly manner.

If there is a real problem, if there would be staff in mall spending too much time on parking some carts, they would hire someone to do it. If the staff would have to extend their workhours to do some job on top of their duties..they would say something and it would change again. So, see? All solves on its own when it comes to it..all is perfect right now. people leave work when there is official end of the shift and carts are not scattered all over the place.
