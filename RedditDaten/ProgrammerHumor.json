Note that programming is interpreted in a narrow sense, an analogy to something related to programming, feelings/reactions etc. are not considered sufficient.\n\nRule #1: No hotlinking allowed without explicit permission, unless it is obvious that the host allows it (e.g. Imgur). Rehosting for the purposes of offering a direct link to an image is allowed in the comments.\n\nRule #2: Everything that's been on the first 2 pages (50 posts) of trending posts within the last two weeks, is part of the top of all time, or is part of the common posts \\[list yet to be built\\] is considered a repost and will be removed.\n\nRule #3: No low quality, low effort posts. Please note that what counts as a low quality or low effort post is defined by the mods and is subject to change at any time.\n\nQuick note about the subjectivity of Rule #3: This relies a lot of feedback from the community when removing stuff / the reports on posts that don't get removed.\n\n# Mod Applications\n\nMod applications are now open.

A `Maybe String` isn't actually a string, so you cannot concatenate it; a `Maybe Int` isn't actually an int, so you cannot add to it; and a `Maybe [Int]` isn't actually a list, so you cannot index it. If you want to _use_ the value inside the \"Maybe\", you _must_ provide case-matching logic or else the compiler will refuse to build your code, due to a type error.\n\nNow, Haskell does unfortunately allow incomplete pattern matching by default, but this can be disabled with compiler option flags.
