Note that programming is interpreted in a narrow sense, an analogy to something related to programming, feelings/reactions etc. are not considered sufficient.\n\nRule #1: No hotlinking allowed without explicit permission, unless it is obvious that the host allows it (e.g. Imgur). Rehosting for the purposes of offering a direct link to an image is allowed in the comments.\n\nRule #2: Everything that's been on the first 2 pages (50 posts) of trending posts within the last two weeks, is part of the top of all time, or is part of the common posts \\[list yet to be built\\] is considered a repost and will be removed.\n\nRule #3: No low quality, low effort posts. Please note that what counts as a low quality or low effort post is defined by the mods and is subject to change at any time.\n\nQuick note about the subjectivity of Rule #3: This relies a lot of feedback from the community when removing stuff / the reports on posts that don't get removed.\n\n# Mod Applications\n\nMod applications are now open.

Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their \"level of incompetence\". In other words, employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was enunciated in the 1969 book The Peter Principle by Peter and Raymond Hull.The Peter Principle was published by William Morrow and Company in 1969. Peter and Hull intended the book to be satire, but it became popular as it was seen to make a serious point about the shortcomings of how people are promoted within hierarchical organizations.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 2, "likes": 0, "upvote": 2, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "ChickenNoodle519", "id": "e5felt0", "url": "/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/9czr93/it_jobs_explained_with_a_broken_lightbulp/e5felt0/", "content": "So many problems solved by making developers carry the pager too", "score": 7, "likes": 0, "upvote": 7, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "chillidoor", "id": "e5fgiz9", "url": "/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/9czr93/it_jobs_explained_with_a_broken_lightbulp/e5fgiz9/", "content": "Yeah.
