This baby boasts a mighty FX-8120 processor and a lightning fast R7 360 AMD Graphics card. It's hard drive is the ever popular Western Digital WD10EZEX with 1GB of space (used to be a Seagate but it broke down). All the space you could ever need.\n\nThe power supply has 500w and I have no idea who made it (What's life without a little mystery?). Whoever it was, they did a good job because it's been working flawlessly for the last 5 years without a single complaint. The case has 2 USB 3.0 ports (they have never worked) and a DVD drive (that also doesn't work, it's stuck, but it's not like anyone uses those so it's fine).\n\nThe monitor is 21.5 inches big and has a TN panel. It has served me faithfully since 2011 until a month ago. People who zoom in may notice a green line running through the monitor, a minor error that occurred recently, but I have since learned to ignore it.\n\nThe Keyboard is a membrane one. Now, I know you all prefer your mechanical keyboards but I got this keyboard 7 years ago and it's been perfect. I haven't had to replace it once. The same can't be said for the mouse (I went through like 5 of them).\n\nThe more observant among you may have noticed and figured out my mouse's identity. It's a G502 Proteus Spectrum, a mouse I got for my birthday earlier this year. I can say without reservation that it's the best mouse I ever had. I am very satisfied with it but that's to be expected of the most expensive peripheral I've ever owned (Yay for discount coupons). The scroll wheel has rusted a bit since I bought it, but it still performs perfectly.\n\nI've had this monster of a PC for 5 years now, and I anticipate I'll be using it for at least a few more years. It's a good thing it's so powerful then. This is why you future proof your hardware.\n\nHail the PCMR and thank you #Razer!\n\n\n\n", "score": 22, "likes": 0, "upvote": 22, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "EnderProGaming", "id": "e5a78xs", "url": "/r/pcmasterrace/comments/9c8eof/giveaway_raise_the_level_cap_and_score_a_gtx_1080/e5a78xs/", "content": "i see you have ddlc on that desktop there, a man of culture", "score": 3, "likes": 0, "upvote": 3, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "Lesander123", "id": "e5agkt8", "url": "/r/pcmasterrace/comments/9c8eof/giveaway_raise_the_level_cap_and_score_a_gtx_1080/e5agkt8/", "content": "Thank you.

The only other part that has survived upgrade refreshes is the DVD drive, which I'm not even sure I grabbed the right one in the part picker. Been debating upgrading it to a Fractal Design R6, but it still meets my needs. \n\nThe most recent build is a refresh a little over 2 years ago after my original MoBo and CPU gave up the ghost. Got my CPU OC'ed and stable @ 4.4 Ghz. The GPU for my current build was originally a 970 GTX, but my wife swapped out her 1060 with me. \n\nI would not suggest ever getting the Tendak USB hub on the front; never gets usb 3.0 speeds and half the time fails to read. It basically has become a spare usb hub to charge my wireless headphones that I use with my phone. I do however recommend the Anker USB hub; I could harp all day about Anker to the point you guys would think I was a paid shill. Their USB cables are just the best. \n\nMy desk is a thrift store find; seemed to be from some kind of government use desk. It was the only desk that fit my need; a keyboard tray that stretches the entire desk. Seriously, why is that so hard to find? It did have a flap on the front of the tray that I removed, as I found it annoying.\n\nAnd yeah, my desk is a bit messy. I didn't really want to clean it up and take some staged photo. Besides some light dusting (holy shit I need to dust the back of my keyboard tray more - found that out after looking at the first picture I took. Thanks camera flash) and moving some papers with personal info off the desk, it pretty much looks like this most days.

Also got a Canon printer and a generic speaker.\n\nBefore you guys witch hunt me for having a MacBook, let me tell you this: I didn't want one.\n\nOur school required us to buy one, and so my parents bought me one. I've been using it for 3 years now, and it's limitations are stopping me from doing anything other than homework, talking with friends and playing really light games. I've tried convincing my parents to let me build my own PC since my old PC died (it was the dreaded family pc that I obtained from my family friend; still way better than a Mac though), but they think that Price=Performance, so they won't even listen to me.\n\nI really want the peripherals and the 1080, since it can really give me a kickstart on my venture into the deep forests of PC Gaming. I'd probably sell the 1080, to get myself a nice CPU, MOBO, RAM, GPU AND HDD.\n\nBest of luck to everyone who enters, and if you've gotten this far into reading my submission, then... well... good for you!\n\nThanks u/Cult_Of_Razer!\n\n\\#Razer #RazerChroma #PCMR", "score": 1, "likes": 0, "upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}, {"author": "Anaalipupu", "id": "e5bemlj", "url": "/r/pcmasterrace/comments/9c8eof/giveaway_raise_the_level_cap_and_score_a_gtx_1080/e5bemlj/", "content": "Thank you for the awesome giveaway!
