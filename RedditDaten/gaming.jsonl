I didn't want to do it, no one in the whole goddamn office wanted to do it, but readers want to know what happened and rookie's get all the shit stuff. The only thing I could do was be as respectful as possible.\n\nIt was probably one of the most interesting experiences I've had in a long time.

Getting out old picturebooks, telling old stories, lot's of crying, anger,... but also a sort of... catharticism. They talked and talked, letting it all out. No barriers, no filters, just an open-hearted conversation with a complete stranger.\n\nThey just told me their son's story, and I wrote it down exactly as they wanted. Somewhere in the back of my mind I hope I indirectly did some good for them. Getting their story out, sharing their grief but also their pride for their son who was no longer a part of the world. \n\nI'm not saying there aren't plenty of shit journalists out there, because there are, but every story is a shade of grey.

Almost nothing from the E3 2011 showing (when it won 85 e3 awards) was in the final release, just 18 months later.\n\nVideo game development does not work much like film development. In a film a script might be written and rewritten for years between a screenwriter and a director/producer, but then shot in 30-90 days without a lot of changes. In a game everything gets changed all the time because you don't know how the gameplay is going to *feel* until you have a lot of assets made. Then as you tweak the gameplay you need to rework the assets, and as you start to run it on dev kits you need to rework it again, then your testers say that some minor part of the game is way more fun than the intended gameplay loop and *everything* gets reworked to fit that and boom, you have an entirely different game.\n\nStanley Kubrick once said that he wouldn't start filming until he knew how every single second of the film was going to look and sound, like how a chess master doesn't make a move until he knows how they are going to win. Game developers have the mantra \"fail faster\". Keep building, keep improving and refine it until its perfect. If they tried to embrace Kubrick's technique their games would be clunky and awkward, just as if he had embraced the \"fail faster\" technique his films would have been stilted and pedestrian.

It's because those side water tiles were wild encounter tiles but didn't have any information associated with them, so it ends up using whatever encounter information was used last. The \"Old Man\" teaching you the encounter copies your character's name temporarily to that specific location so you end up with some goofy shit based on your character's name, including pokemon like 'MISSINGNO.\" which would result in the duplication of one of your bag items.\n\nBut, That is not all. The glitch meant you would also see some other Pokemon based on your name. My usual Game name would cause me to see Level 168 Porygons, for example. More recently I sculpted a name for my Pokemon red Cartridge which let's me see Wild Mewtwo in the same way. I had some other Pokemon in mind but I forgot what they were, I'll let it be a surprise once I get there.\n\nBut- There's more.\n\nIt uses the last \"encounter\" information that was set, right?\n\nAnd you know how some pokemon are exclusive to the Safari zone?\n\nNot wasting my time with that game of chance.
