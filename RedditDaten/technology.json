A lot of the security technology is pretty new.\n\nmore brick and mortar competition still existed, and many people didnt have the speed to utilize such services. Also a change in generations happened where less people are ever going to buy previously breadwinning services -- the millennial generation is one of the last that will remember what cable and satellite TV are -- these are antiquated, hub-like networks that no longer have purpose in society, and actually at the backend really work the same as modern internet... Dropping prices of hardware also influence this, as now anyone can afford a raspberry pi.\n\ndropoffs in cable TV sales and news ratings were not yet as drastic, and much of the infrastructure still wasnt fully digital on the backend yet, something many providers JUST switched to. Even time warner still used to broadcast analog over coax up until spectrum dropped it a few days ago.\n\nat first, they thought users were uneducated, and simply blocking a protocol or site, might work. but they quickly found out they would need even more overreaching policies, in order to stop it.\n\nbecause, I can just use a SOCKS5 proxy or VPN and effectively get around any policy they create.\n\nthe only way to mitigate what they view as losses, yet the consumers and most of the industry, view as a god-given right, the only thing they can do is deeply inspect the context of each connection and make guesses based on that;\n\nwhen they say 'prioritization of traffic' the first thing that comes to mind for me, is industrial SPI firewall with caching enabled on specific sites.\n\nsee, this way, if your using a VPN or encryption the firewall can still report back saying \"stream/download -- block\", or \"invalid request, server being contacted is VPN server -- block if VPN remote access service not enabled\"\n\nthis would work so much better than just saying 'no bittorrent' or 'no alt news' or whatever.\n\nit would literally become like china -- but possibly worse because in China, monitoring every single connection under a single government controlled ISP, is MUCH MORE DIFFICULT than leaving that up to the hands of private industry who stands to make money and will heavily invest in such things.\n\ntheres a lot more little examples too, but those are the first things that come to mind for me.\n\na lot has indeed changed, whereas saying \"oh it was fine then\" does not apply.\n\nfor example, its inaccurate to say that \"everything was fine in the 50s, so its fine now\" -- this is a ridiculous blanket statement that does not account for any of the problems between now and then.\n\nit wouldnt matter how well the economy was doing then -- go ahead implement the same rules and see where it gets you. nowhere. the rules were failing and thats why changes happened to begin with. rolling them back only serves to make undoing the mistake an even more uphill battle. \n\nNow your going to have corporations protecting profits. which is why I believe a temporary 'Emperor' like Caesar is necessary to DICTATE profit destroying laws that forcibly restructure and decentralize targeted industries, disabling them from having a single say in any democratic process -- and actually amend these things into the constitution.\n\nthe reason I say this, is because look what happens if you leave the ability to do so in place... they will keep trying, keep changing things one word at a time, until it passes; continue to throw money at the 'problem' from their endless pockets, knowing full well it will pay for itself in a year when it goes through. you have to simply protect from that with threats of imprisonment or death, and definitely loss of assets -- not threats from the individual, but threats from society as a whole, not through repressive government but by mandate of the people a.k.a. consumers while taking into account what the business actually needs -- not what its CEO and board of directors wants, but ONLY what it needs to remain profitable above a certain percentage not determined by them.\n\nif determination of profits and CBA is only performed by the business itself, it will NEVER be enough. growth must be eternal (which is impossible) and they will always want more. 100% profit isnt enough, the 200% then 300%... until they've reached a max capacity where people simply cannot pay more.", "score": 8, "likes": 0, "upvote": 8, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "None", "id": "draq3w7", "url": "/r/technology/comments/7jv9ln/any_form_of_threatening_harassing_or_violence/draq3w7/", "content": "TL;DR\n\nin short, as new technologies replace the old, and old laws which were written specifically targeting the outdated ones are being replaced.\n\nit opens corporations an opportunity to revise things like fair use, and the very definitions of services and terms, essentially re-deciding already decided cases that ruled against them in the past. \n\ninstead, the terms should remain the same, no matter who's profits are impacted. if you fail in the new market, you failed to invest properly and if this was a free market, it would be considered a holy blessing that your titanic industry fell and hundreds of small time competitors replaced you.", "score": 4, "likes": 0, "upvote": 4, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "PM_ME_BIASED_MODS", "id": "draw4eo", "url": "/r/technology/comments/7jv9ln/any_form_of_threatening_harassing_or_violence/draw4eo/", "content": "You realize there was no NN before 2015 right?", "score": 1, "likes": 0, "upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}]}, {"author": "LegendaryPunk", "id": "drvcf04", "url": "/r/technology/comments/7jv9ln/any_form_of_threatening_harassing_or_violence/drvcf04/", "content": "Thank you!

Won't be allowed to write a program like VOIP if a corporation has already implemented the service themselves -- and really this is a large motivation behind the push for cloud services and the end of true personal computing in general. Give consumers stripped, locked down devices like phones that can't be modded under penalty of law, no development tools that are low-level, etc. all in order to force service purchases, where otherwise the same features could be implemented for free or very cheap as a one-time fee.\n\nconservatives are generally more likely to accept these arguments, because they think in terms of the success of existing businesses and profits -- and often times they aren't the most technically inclined people when it comes to their base -- so their base can be more easily made to swallow this hook line and sinker with \"Government tyranny\" as an argument.\n\nand even if they werent -- those at the top don't care, since they can likely afford premium services which negate any negative consequences for them, and increase their consumer base drastically in lower social classes. To them, its a potential final solution against piracy, and possibly even more benign forms of competition as well.\n\nsince the internet has replaced libraries, video rentals, brick and mortar stores, and much much more, it offers them an opportunity to erase decades of consumer protection laws in one fell swoop to enrich themselves. The old laws MUST be extended to cover similar online activities to stop this, rather than giving corporations another shot at getting their way 50+ years later. even if the consequence is a continuation of piracy, and major stock value drops for the most profitable corporations as the paradigm shifts.\n\nIMO, THAT is a free market.\n\nno longer would taking someone out be a game of whack-a-mole relying on technological ignorance of the consumer to function.

Most only have two, and that's usually a choice between terrible and awful. \n\nAnd why do you think that is?  Or did you just never consider why.\n\nWhen you go to the grocery store you can choose between Coke, Pepsi, RC, store brand, and dozens of others.  But what if the government stepped in and said they all have to use the same formula?  With no way to make a profit with different taste and caffeine, they'd make exclusive deals where one whole region only sells Coke and another only sells Pepsi (they already do this with restaurants).  In markets where exclusive deals are prohibited after the first price war you'd have a single crappy producer left standing.  \n\nBy enforcing equal \"taste\" you'd be actually *creating* a monopoly single-producer.  This is what happens with net neutrality.  Comcast lobbies to prevent any other competitors because all the data \"tastes\" the same so the best way to extract profit is to prevent competition in the first place.  Google forces their way in and maybe eventually puts Comcast out of business, but nobody will compete with Google because there's no profit with all data being equal - until Google service becomes so crappy that somebody thinks they can off them entirely and become the new monopoly.\n\nNow consider the opposite, a Comcast monopoly where they are ~~extorting~~ charging Netflix a huge fee.  A ISP competitor can come in and say \"hey Netflix make a deal with us for half as much\" and they get the profit they need to build out their network.  That new ISP and Comcast can actually coexist in the market - just like Coke and Pepsi can.  This maybe costs more and is more complicated for people that just want internet, but it increases competition and choice.\n\nPrivate companies with enforced net neutrality is the shittiest solution because it creates shitty, poorly run ISP monopolies.

Here's what it does:\n\nYou type in www.reddit.com to your browser. The internet doesn't work with words, only IP addresses. So the first thing your computer does is use the DNS to \"resolve\" or translate the domain name into an IP address. \n\nTo do this, it sends your request (www.reddit.com) to the DNS server it has programmed into its settings (your ISP is usually the default, but there are many DNS's available to use including Google's 8.8.8.8). It sends your request to the DNS, the DNS then looks up what IP your web domain request is listed under in its files, and returns that IP (151.101.1.140 for reddit.com) to your router. Your router can now find reddit's server and request the page you're looking for and return that to your browser for your enjoyment.\n\nYour ISP and Google's DNS's are relatively secure, but as we're finding out more and more these days, nothing is 100% secure so **always** be vigilant when it comes to the Internet. \n\nIf you point your router to a DNS that then becomes vulnerable to a blackhat attack, they can then redirect your DNS request to their own server instead of the one you wanted. It may look, act, and feel like the regular website depending on how elaborate the attack is, but the tell is in your browser's URL bar. The little green lock symbol means it's a secure site, if that's ever missing or is otherwise different, that means the site you're viewing may not be secure, and any login or other information you provide to that site may be visible to third parties.\n\nAlways make sure your browser tells you the page is secure before entering personal info! That's rule #1 for today's Internet.\n\nEdit to completely answer your question: aside from the aforementioned possible threats, changing your DNS to any reputable one will not functionally affect your web browsing in any way, it's just a lookup service\n\n\nTL;DR: DNS is basically a yellow pages for the internet, translates domain names into IP addresses. If you program your router to a DNS that's either malicious in nature or becomes malicious later due to an attack, it may direct you to a site that's set up to steal your information without you ever knowing.

The whole system is convoluted and decentralized so it's difficult to describe, but in most of the US electricity is quite inexpensive as a result. \n\nEdit: for further detail, utilities essentially purchase power from generation companies that they then deliver to homes. This model has lead to far more natural gas-fueled power plants as they can be ramped up and down to meet demand far easier than coal or nuclear plants (while also generally being far less carbon/pollutant emitting than coal). There are also requirements that utilities must purchase certain amounts of their power from renewable sources which can vary by state. For my home state of Washington where nearly 70% of power comes from hydroelectric dams, such requirements are unnecessary.

It's the type of attack you suggest out loud when you don't know what you're fucking talking about.\n\nThere's zero doubt any politician like *any other human* has a residential connection which will be leased a Random (free) IP address from their ISPs pool of IPs for any given session.\n\nMeaning 1, you need to obtain it to start, and 2, it can change literally every new session.\n\nTo make it harder for anyone. You need to actually *get* their IP address as in, how would you even start. If you know their official reddit account, and they're logged in, and you're an admin at reddit and they're browsing *right now* from their home PC, you'd have it.\n\nBut us? On the outside? It's infeasible to even start thinking about it. You'd need to get into their WiFi, or get a ***serious*** hack into some site they frequent and start watching logs/sessions for them. And all this can go away if they restart their router and get a new IP leased from their ISP.\n\nBut lets say you get it, what are you going to do, flood their home network with traffic? Cool. \"My internet doesn't work time to restart the router because rebooting fixes everything right?\" new IP.\n\nBut of course if this kept happening you'd get your own ISP questioning wtf you're doing eventually too.\n\nAnd this would all be a Denial of Service Attack if there were any services hosted on their local network actually listening to the traffic you're throwing at it. The best you could hope for is saturating their router with enough connection requests that it lags up trying to either REJECT or DROP them all, if they don't have any ports forwarded or anything, there's no service to attack and the router will just drop you, so that would be the only method available, making the router busy with binning your packets.\n\n***Distributed*** Denial of Service attacks involve multiple parties (Or at least hosts) performing this, not just one guy. There are newer and potentially more powerful options available with more people, but in the end, if there's no services to attack on their residential connection it's all mostly for waste. You really have to overextend your efforts to cause network issues on their router when all it needs to do is 'DROP' your packets.\n\n\nAnd you know, all the legal implications in-between every single successful step.", "score": 14, "likes": 0, "upvote": 14, "downvote": 0, "comments": []}]}, {"author": "drdeadringer", "id": "e5ey80h", "url": "/r/technology/comments/9czskt/study_telecoms_have_been_throttling_youtube_and/e5ey80h/", "content": "Good old government money and \"public data\" for Bezos I guess.", "score": 4, "likes": 0, "upvote": 4, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}]}, {"author": "msg45f", "id": "e5epq6t", "url": "/r/technology/comments/9czskt/study_telecoms_have_been_throttling_youtube_and/e5epq6t/", "content": "Starting our own internet with blackjack and hookers.", "score": 15, "likes": 0, "upvote": 15, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}, {"author": "Deepspacesquid", "id": "e5epzpd", "url": "/r/technology/comments/9czskt/study_telecoms_have_been_throttling_youtube_and/e5epzpd/", "content": "No hacktivist needed - vote in November.

So the bandwidth restrictions were because those peering links (through Level 3 if memory serves) were getting completely saturated, causing a slowdown for everybody. \n\nFWIW, I actually see the reasoning behind making Netflix pay; Those peering links were set up with the mutual agreement that they would be roughly \u201cflow neutral\u201d, and that those links would be maintained without charging each side as long as it stayed flow neutral. Of course, those peering agreements were put in place long before content delivery became a thing... all of a sudden ISPs were being forced to stand up a ton of new hardware out of pocket to deal with the massive amounts of one way data coming through those links, while Level 3 on the other side of the link would shrug and say \u201ceh, not our problem.\u201d  So the ISPs went after Google and Netflix to help pay for the upgrades their massive data usage required. \n\nA lot has changed since then. Netflix and YoTube both use caching servers set up on the ISP networks now, to help ease the congestion on the peering links, as well as deliver content faster to their subscribers. Overuse of peering links that go well beyond the \u201croughly equal\u201d peering agreement will likely still result in the ISPs demanding more payments from content delivery services. \n\nKeep in mind this was all perfectly legal under the NN rules that Shit Pie so gleefully tore up.

I might do it later and update this comment, to see if the 360 would be as expensive as ps3 or not after all the extra shit.\n\n\u200b\n\nEDIT: So the PS3 came out in 2006, at that time there were only 2 options for buying a 360 at a retail store, which is what I'm going to be using for this scenario. The 360 offered two bundles, XBOX 360 Premium (20GB), and XBOX 360 Core (which apparently didn't come with a hard drive, unless I'm missing something).\n\nSince I can't find the initial prices for HDD's on 360 after a few google searches, we're just gonna go with the $400 price for the Premium that comes with a hard drive. The official Microsoft router was $89 at retail during the release period (2005-2007ish) with a few $20 sales here and there (but I remember those sales were very infrequent and didn't last long). I don't believe xbox live membership costs have really changed since the 360 days ($60 for a year, right? although I feel like it used to be $40 for some reason, hm.), so we'll add that onto the cost. I mean, you're not just gonna play online for a month and then never use online features again, right?\n\n\u200b\n\nSo altogether, after peripherals, the 360 costed $549 before taxes. that's\n\n$400 (pro console)\n\n$89 (Microsoft adapter)\n\n$60 (year of XBL)\n\n\u200b\n\nThe PS3 cost either $499 or $599 at launch, depending on whether you got the cheaper model or not. HOWEVER the cheaper model lacked many features, so we're gonna say as a PRO GAMER we want the $599 model.\n\n\u200b\n\nOverall, a PS3 was really just $50 bucks more expensive than a 360, but with a 360 you didn't buy all of your console at once, it was sold to you in pieces (HDMI cable, Internet connectivity, etc.) which made the cost SEEM lower than it actually was, since you could stretch it out like a car payment.\n\n\u200b\n\nHowever if we factor in the console's lifespan 2005-2013 and put $60 for each year of XBL, the \"true cost\" is much different. \n\n2013-2005=8.\n\n8\\*60=$480 total cost for using XBL throughout the 360's lifespan up until the Xbox One came out.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo, in \"true cost\" the Xbox 360 cost $1,029 for a console generation of usage, whereas the PS3 cost $599 for a console generation of usage. Obviously this is a theoretical cost analysis, some consoles break, you have to buy extra controllers, maybe you got a console cheap during a sale, bla bla bla, but the fact remains that the XBL subscription costed me (and other 360 users) WAY more in the long run than a PS3 would have.\n\n\u200b\n\ntl;dr Xbox 360 was slightly cheaper in the short term even with peripherals, but factoring in the cost of an online subscription, the Xbox 360 costed me almost twice as much as a PS3 would have in the time frame of usage.", "score": 17, "likes": 0, "upvote": 17, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "someone31988", "id": "e5du8zh", "url": "/r/technology/comments/9cu1xv/playstation_2_repair_services_close_in_japan_sony/e5du8zh/", "content": "You can throw that HDMI cable out of there because the very first Xbox 360 consoles didn't have an HDMI port.

After months of playing the first one she finally beat. It was the first game she ever finished on her own. The smile on her face when the credits rolled was priceless.\n\nGod of War 2 - I really liked the first game but the second one took everything from the first one and upped it by 10.

On this occasion, he was in Tokyo for a big tournament. While he was there, his fancy new Sony Walkman (a tape player) stopped working. He set out to find an electronics store, which, being in Japan, couldn't be that hard to find. The only complicating factor is that he didn't speak a word of Japanese. \n\nHe first went to the concierge at his hotel, who luckily spoke a few words of English. He explained his problem and the concierge seemed to understand, responding by writing an address on a card: \"go here\". My dad took the card and showed it to a taxi driver, who drove him through the streets of Tokyo before pulling over at his destination. \n\nHe paid his fare and then looked around to find the electronics store... Only there wasn't one. There were plenty of opportunities for miscommunication and he nearly resigned to going back to the hotel. Then he looked up... And up, and up, to a big sign on top of the building in front of him: \"SONY\".\n\nHe had been sent, with all the best intentions, to Sony Headquarters. He laughed but knew that they would not have a repair centre inside. However, he decided in a last gasp effort that the reception inside might speak more English and might be able to direct him  somewhere more useful. He walked in and explained his problem, thinking he might get another card with another address. Instead they asked him to wait and made a phone call in Japanese, which lasted a minute of two. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he started preparing to leave, but suddenly receptionist got up and walked him to an elevator, pressed the number for a very high floor, and then left the elevator before the doors could close.\n\nSo here is my dad, very confused at this point, alone in an elevator rocketing up to the highest floors of Sony HQ. The doors open to an empty hallway with several unmarked doors. Again, he waits a minute of two, and right before he can abort and go back down, a door opens and three small (they were probably normal sized, but everyone is small to my 6'9 dad), Japanese men wearing lab coats, pop out from a door and come over to him. They take the Walkman from his hand and start examining and discussing it, then disappear with it back through the door, closing it behind them.\n\nIt suddenly dawns on him, and, if it hadn't already, you: this isn't any sort of repair centre. This is the bleeding edge. This is Sony R&D, on the highest floors of one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, Sony HQ. These guys don't just build electronics, they design them! And they're fixing my dad's Walkman. \n\nNow, we Kiwis are a very understated people (except when in comes to rugby) and the fact that he ended up here, wasting the time of some of the smartest people in the world so that he can listen to his new AC/DC album, is both bewildering and incredibly embarrassing. But at this point it would be even more rude to leave, so he sits and waits while his walkman is fixed by the guys who probably invented it.\n\nEventually they come out, waving his walkman and excitedly showing that it now works. He pulls out his wallet, but through the language barrier, they make it very clear that they will accept no money. So he thanks then profusely, goes on his way with a story he, and I, and maybe now you, weil never forget.", "score": 21, "likes": 0, "upvote": 21, "downvote": 0, "comments": []}, {"author": "amidoes", "id": "e5deou9", "url": "/r/technology/comments/9cu1xv/playstation_2_repair_services_close_in_japan_sony/e5deou9/", "content": "IMO the PS2 is the best all around console ever.
