A lot of the security technology is pretty new.\n\nmore brick and mortar competition still existed, and many people didnt have the speed to utilize such services. Also a change in generations happened where less people are ever going to buy previously breadwinning services -- the millennial generation is one of the last that will remember what cable and satellite TV are -- these are antiquated, hub-like networks that no longer have purpose in society, and actually at the backend really work the same as modern internet... Dropping prices of hardware also influence this, as now anyone can afford a raspberry pi.\n\ndropoffs in cable TV sales and news ratings were not yet as drastic, and much of the infrastructure still wasnt fully digital on the backend yet, something many providers JUST switched to. Even time warner still used to broadcast analog over coax up until spectrum dropped it a few days ago.\n\nat first, they thought users were uneducated, and simply blocking a protocol or site, might work. but they quickly found out they would need even more overreaching policies, in order to stop it.\n\nbecause, I can just use a SOCKS5 proxy or VPN and effectively get around any policy they create.\n\nthe only way to mitigate what they view as losses, yet the consumers and most of the industry, view as a god-given right, the only thing they can do is deeply inspect the context of each connection and make guesses based on that;\n\nwhen they say 'prioritization of traffic' the first thing that comes to mind for me, is industrial SPI firewall with caching enabled on specific sites.\n\nsee, this way, if your using a VPN or encryption the firewall can still report back saying \"stream/download -- block\", or \"invalid request, server being contacted is VPN server -- block if VPN remote access service not enabled\"\n\nthis would work so much better than just saying 'no bittorrent' or 'no alt news' or whatever.\n\nit would literally become like china -- but possibly worse because in China, monitoring every single connection under a single government controlled ISP, is MUCH MORE DIFFICULT than leaving that up to the hands of private industry who stands to make money and will heavily invest in such things.\n\ntheres a lot more little examples too, but those are the first things that come to mind for me.\n\na lot has indeed changed, whereas saying \"oh it was fine then\" does not apply.\n\nfor example, its inaccurate to say that \"everything was fine in the 50s, so its fine now\" -- this is a ridiculous blanket statement that does not account for any of the problems between now and then.\n\nit wouldnt matter how well the economy was doing then -- go ahead implement the same rules and see where it gets you. nowhere. the rules were failing and thats why changes happened to begin with. rolling them back only serves to make undoing the mistake an even more uphill battle. \n\nNow your going to have corporations protecting profits. which is why I believe a temporary 'Emperor' like Caesar is necessary to DICTATE profit destroying laws that forcibly restructure and decentralize targeted industries, disabling them from having a single say in any democratic process -- and actually amend these things into the constitution.\n\nthe reason I say this, is because look what happens if you leave the ability to do so in place... they will keep trying, keep changing things one word at a time, until it passes; continue to throw money at the 'problem' from their endless pockets, knowing full well it will pay for itself in a year when it goes through. you have to simply protect from that with threats of imprisonment or death, and definitely loss of assets -- not threats from the individual, but threats from society as a whole, not through repressive government but by mandate of the people a.k.a. consumers while taking into account what the business actually needs -- not what its CEO and board of directors wants, but ONLY what it needs to remain profitable above a certain percentage not determined by them.\n\nif determination of profits and CBA is only performed by the business itself, it will NEVER be enough. growth must be eternal (which is impossible) and they will always want more. 100% profit isnt enough, the 200% then 300%... until they've reached a max capacity where people simply cannot pay more.", "score": 9, "likes": 0, "upvote": 9, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "None", "id": "draq3w7", "url": "/r/technology/comments/7jv9ln/any_form_of_threatening_harassing_or_violence/draq3w7/", "content": "TL;DR\n\nin short, as new technologies replace the old, and old laws which were written specifically targeting the outdated ones are being replaced.\n\nit opens corporations an opportunity to revise things like fair use, and the very definitions of services and terms, essentially re-deciding already decided cases that ruled against them in the past. \n\ninstead, the terms should remain the same, no matter who's profits are impacted. if you fail in the new market, you failed to invest properly and if this was a free market, it would be considered a holy blessing that your titanic industry fell and hundreds of small time competitors replaced you.", "score": 3, "likes": 0, "upvote": 3, "downvote": 0, "comments": [{"author": "PM_ME_BIASED_MODS", "id": "draw4eo", "url": "/r/technology/comments/7jv9ln/any_form_of_threatening_harassing_or_violence/draw4eo/", "content": "You realize there was no NN before 2015 right?", "score": 1, "likes": 0, "upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "comments": 0}]}, {"author": "LegendaryPunk", "id": "drvcf04", "url": "/r/technology/comments/7jv9ln/any_form_of_threatening_harassing_or_violence/drvcf04/", "content": "Thank you!

Won't be allowed to write a program like VOIP if a corporation has already implemented the service themselves -- and really this is a large motivation behind the push for cloud services and the end of true personal computing in general. Give consumers stripped, locked down devices like phones that can't be modded under penalty of law, no development tools that are low-level, etc. all in order to force service purchases, where otherwise the same features could be implemented for free or very cheap as a one-time fee.\n\nconservatives are generally more likely to accept these arguments, because they think in terms of the success of existing businesses and profits -- and often times they aren't the most technically inclined people when it comes to their base -- so their base can be more easily made to swallow this hook line and sinker with \"Government tyranny\" as an argument.\n\nand even if they werent -- those at the top don't care, since they can likely afford premium services which negate any negative consequences for them, and increase their consumer base drastically in lower social classes. To them, its a potential final solution against piracy, and possibly even more benign forms of competition as well.\n\nsince the internet has replaced libraries, video rentals, brick and mortar stores, and much much more, it offers them an opportunity to erase decades of consumer protection laws in one fell swoop to enrich themselves. The old laws MUST be extended to cover similar online activities to stop this, rather than giving corporations another shot at getting their way 50+ years later. even if the consequence is a continuation of piracy, and major stock value drops for the most profitable corporations as the paradigm shifts.\n\nIMO, THAT is a free market.\n\nno longer would taking someone out be a game of whack-a-mole relying on technological ignorance of the consumer to function.

Most only have two, and that's usually a choice between terrible and awful. \n\nAnd why do you think that is?  Or did you just never consider why.\n\nWhen you go to the grocery store you can choose between Coke, Pepsi, RC, store brand, and dozens of others.  But what if the government stepped in and said they all have to use the same formula?  With no way to make a profit with different taste and caffeine, they'd make exclusive deals where one whole region only sells Coke and another only sells Pepsi (they already do this with restaurants).  In markets where exclusive deals are prohibited after the first price war you'd have a single crappy producer left standing.  \n\nBy enforcing equal \"taste\" you'd be actually *creating* a monopoly single-producer.  This is what happens with net neutrality.  Comcast lobbies to prevent any other competitors because all the data \"tastes\" the same so the best way to extract profit is to prevent competition in the first place.  Google forces their way in and maybe eventually puts Comcast out of business, but nobody will compete with Google because there's no profit with all data being equal - until Google service becomes so crappy that somebody thinks they can off them entirely and become the new monopoly.\n\nNow consider the opposite, a Comcast monopoly where they are ~~extorting~~ charging Netflix a huge fee.  A ISP competitor can come in and say \"hey Netflix make a deal with us for half as much\" and they get the profit they need to build out their network.  That new ISP and Comcast can actually coexist in the market - just like Coke and Pepsi can.  This maybe costs more and is more complicated for people that just want internet, but it increases competition and choice.\n\nPrivate companies with enforced net neutrality is the shittiest solution because it creates shitty, poorly run ISP monopolies.

Perhaps if people listened then, my family would not have to sit inside for over a month due to visible ash raining and smoke so thick it obscures your vision within 5 feet.

Extreme heat for long periods dry out underbrush. Lack of rainfall, or too much rainfall in areas that cant handle it is bad.

The urban/wildfire interface is crazy in California due to a burgeoning population. Logging chaparral and oak? California isn't some untamed land with pristine landscapes and virgin forests everywhere. It's as cultivated and settled as they come. And dry as shit. Also, clear-cuts from logging burn just as well as if not faster, than a mature forest. The benefit of logging is more of the logging roads providing firebreaks.  Colorado isn't California. Totally different fuels. California is loaded with chaparral, oaks and lots of other shrub and grass. Redding wasn't surrounded by fir forests. Thinning a fir or pine forest mimics what was once the natural 10-15 year cycle of fire by keeping ladder fuels low. This will reduce the intensity of the fire. A fire with minimal ladder fuels will burn through but not harm mature fir and pine trees. Much of California, especially near populated areas, is pure ladder fuels.
